[{"author": "Ryan Holiday", "headline": "An ancient guide to solving all work problems once and for all", "body": "The image of the Zen philosopher is the monk up in the green, quiet hills, or in a beautiful temple on some rocky cliff. The Stoic, on the other hand, is the antithesis of this idea. The Stoic is the man in the marketplace, the merchant on a voyage, the senator in the Forum, the soldier at the front. In other words, they are like you.\nThose jobs might not seem like one well-suited for \u201cphilosophy,\u201d but they are. And so are you. For in even the most modern seeming professions, a Stoic is able to peace and clarity. For thousands of years, Stoicism has been a tool for the ordinary and the elite alive\u2014from slaves to emperors\u2014as they sought wisdom, strength and the \u2018good life.\u2019 It was philosophy designed for action--for doers--not for the classroom.\nWhich is why it has been popular with everyone from Marcus Aurelius and Seneca (one of the richest men in Rome), to Theodore Roosevelt, Frederick the Great and Michel de Montaigne. More recently, Stoicism has been cited by investors like Tim Ferriss and executives like Jonathan Newhouse, the CEO of Cond\u00e9 Nast International. Even football coaches like Pete Carroll of the Seattle Seahawks and baseball managers like Jeff Banister of the Texas Rangers have recommended Stoicism to their players.\nHow can we follow in their timeless footsteps? How can we reap the benefits of this operating system in our own workplace? It\u2019s simple. Go to straight to the sources. Below are Stoic exercises and strategies, pulled from the new book The Daily Stoic (and daily email at DailyStoic.com), that will help you navigate your workplace with better clarity, effectiveness, and peace of mind.\nDON\u2019T MAKE THINGS HARDER THAN THEY NEED TO BE\n\u201cIf someone asks you how to write your name, would you bark out each letter? And if they get angry, would you then return the anger? Wouldn\u2019t you rather gently spell out each letter for them? So then, remember in life that your duties are the sum of individual acts. Pay attention to each of these as you do your duty . . . just methodically complete your task.\u201d\u2014Marcus Aurelius, Meditations, 6.26\nHere\u2019s a common scenario. You\u2019re working with a frustrating coworker or a difficult boss. They ask you to do something and, because you dislike the messenger, you immediately object. There\u2019s this problem or that one, or their request is obnoxious and rude. So you tell them, \u201cNo, I\u2019m not going to do it.\u201d Then they retaliate by not doing something that you had previously asked of them. And so the conflict escalates.\nMeanwhile, if you could step back and see it objectively, you\u2019d probably see that not everything they\u2019re asking for is unreasonable. In fact, some of it is pretty easy to do or is, at least, agreeable. And if you did it, it might make the rest of the tasks a bit more tolerable too. Pretty soon, you\u2019ve done the entire thing.\nLife (and our job) is difficult enough. Let\u2019s not make it harder by getting emotional about insignificant matters or digging in for battles we don\u2019t actually care about. Let\u2019s not let emotion get in the way of kathe\u0302kon, the simple, appropriate actions on the path to virtue.\nIMPOSSIBLE WITHOUT YOUR CONSENT\n\u201cToday I escaped from the crush of circumstances, or better put, I threw them out, for the crush wasn\u2019t from outside me but in my own assumptions.\u201d\u2014Marcus Aurelius, Meditations, 9.13\nOn tough days we might say, \u201cMy work is overwhelming,\u201d or \u201cMy boss is really frustrating.\u201d If only we could understand that this is impossible. Someone can\u2019t frustrate you, work can\u2019t overwhelm you-these are external objects, and they have no access to your mind. Those emotions you feel, as real as they are, come from the inside, not the outside.\nThe Stoics use the word hypole\u0302psis, which means \u201ctaking up\u201d\u2014of perceptions, thoughts, and judgments by our mind. What we assume, what we willingly generate in our mind, that\u2019s on us. We can\u2019t blame other people for making us feel stressed or frustrated any more than we can blame them for our jealousy. The cause is within us. They\u2019re just the target.\nA PROPER FRAME OF MIND\n\u201cFrame your thoughts like this\u2014you are an old person, you won\u2019t let yourself be enslaved by this any longer, no longer pulled like a puppet by every impulse, and you\u2019ll stop complaining about your present fortune or dreading the future.\u201d \u2014Marcus Aurelius, Meditations, 2.2\nWe resent the person who comes in and tries to boss us around. Don\u2019t tell me how to dress, how to think, how to do my job, how to live. This is because we are independent, self-sufficient people.\nOr at least that\u2019s what we tell ourselves.\nYet if someone says something we disagree with, something inside us tells us we have to argue with them. If there\u2019s a plate of cookies in front of us, we have to eat them. If someone does something we dislike, we have to get mad about it. When something bad happens, we have to be sad, depressed, or worried. But if something good happens a few minutes later, all of a sudden we\u2019re happy, excited, and want more.\nWe would never let another person jerk us around the way we let our impulses do. It\u2019s time we start seeing it that way\u2014that we\u2019re not puppets that can be made to dance this way or that way just because we feel like it. We should be the ones in control, not our emotions, because we are independent, self-sufficient people.\nKEEP IT SIMPLE\n\u201cAt every moment keep a sturdy mind on the task at hand, as a Roman and human being, doing it with strict and simple dignity, affection, freedom, and justice\u2014giving yourself a break from all other considerations. You can do this if you approach each task as if it is your last, giving up every distraction, emotional subversion of reason, and all drama, vanity, and complaint over your fair share. You can see how mastery over a few things makes it possible to live an abundant and devout life\u2014for, if you keep watch over these things, the gods won\u2019t ask for more.\u201d \u2014 Marcus Aurelius, Meditations, 2.5\nEach day presents the chance to overthink things. What should I wear? Do they like me? Am I eating well enough? What\u2019s next for me in life? Is my boss happy with my work?\nToday, let\u2019s focus just on what\u2019s in front of us. We\u2019ll follow the dictum that New England Patriots coach Bill Belichick gives his players: \u201cDo your job.\u201d Like a Roman, like a good soldier, like a master of our craft. We don\u2019t need to get lost in a thousand other distractions or in other people\u2019s business.\nMarcus says to approach each task as if it were your last, because it very well could be. And even if it isn\u2019t, botching what\u2019s right in front of you doesn\u2019t help anything. Find clarity in the simplicity of doing.\nNEVER DO ANYTHING OUT OF HABIT\n\u201cSo in the majority of other things, we address circumstances not in accordance with the right assumptions, but mostly by following wretched habit. Since all that I\u2019ve said is the case, the person in training must seek to rise above, so as to stop seeking out pleasure and steering away from pain; to stop clinging to living and abhorring death; and in the case of property and money, to stop valuing receiving over giving.\u201d\u2014Musonius Rufus, Lectures, 6.25.5\u201311                                   \nA worker is asked: \u201cWhy did you do it this way?\u201d The answer, \u201cBecause that\u2019s the way we\u2019ve always done things.\u201d The answer frustrates every good boss and sets the mouth of every entrepreneur watering. The worker has stopped thinking and is mindlessly operating out of habit. The business is ripe for disruption by a competitor, and the worker will probably get fired by any thinking boss.\nWe should apply the same ruthlessness to our own habits. In fact, we are studying philosophy precisely to break ourselves of rote behavior. Find what you do out of rote memory or routine. Ask yourself: Is this really the best way to do it? Know why you do what you do\u2014do it for the right reasons.                                                            \nYOUR CAREER IS NOT A LIFE SENTENCE\n\u201cHow disgraceful is the lawyer whose dying breath passes while at court, at an advanced age, pleading for unknown litigants and still seeking the approval of ignorant spectators.\u201d\u2014Seneca, On the Brevity of Life, 20.2\nEvery few years, a sad spectacle is played out in the news. An old millionaire, still lord of his business empire, is taken to court. Shareholders and family members go to court to argue that he is no longer mentally competent to make decisions\u2014that the patriarch is not fit to run his own company and legal affairs. Because this powerful person refused to ever relinquish control or develop a succession plan, he is subjected to one of life\u2019s worst humiliations: the public exposure of his most private vulnerabilities.\nWe must not get so wrapped up in our work that we think we\u2019re immune from the reality of aging and life. Who wants to be the person who can never let go? Is there so little meaning in your life that your only pursuit is work until you\u2019re eventually carted off in a coffin?\nTake pride in your work. But it is not all.                                                            \nPROTECT YOUR PEACE OF MIND\n\u201cKeep constant guard over your perceptions, for it is no small thing you are protecting, but your respect, trustworthiness and steadi- ness, peace of mind, freedom from pain and fear, in a word your freedom. For what would you sell these things?\u201d\u2014Epictetus, Discourses, 4.3.6b\u20138\nThe dysfunctional job that stresses you out, a contentious relationship, life in the spotlight. Stoicism, because it helps us manage and think through our emotional reactions, can make these kinds of situations easier to bear. It can help you manage and mitigate the triggers that seem to be so constantly tripped.\nBut here\u2019s a question: Why are you subjecting yourself to this? Is this really the environment you were made for? To be provoked by nasty emails and an endless parade of workplace problems? Our adrenal glands can handle only so much before they become exhausted. Shouldn\u2019t you preserve them for life-and-death situations?\nSo yes, use Stoicism to manage these difficulties. But don\u2019t forget to ask: Is this really the life I want? Every time you get upset, a little bit of life leaves the body. Are these really the things on which you want to spend that priceless resource? Don\u2019t be afraid to make a change\u2014a big one.\nRyan Holiday is the bestselling author of The Obstacle Is the Wayand Ego is the Enemy, whose forthcoming book, The Daily Stoic: 366 Meditations on Wisdom, Perseverance, and the Art of Living, will be released on October 18.

Editorial decided it would no longer accept columns of this nature on this topic. I have the utmost respect for the leadership at the Observer, but I respectfully disagree with that decision. Anyone who would like to republish the article is welcome to.\nDad, let me start this letter by saying that it isn\u2019t my intention to embarrass you. I find that I can express myself in writing better than I can when we talk on the phone (in fact, if anyone likes this piece, that will be, in its own way, a compliment to you\u2014I developed as a writer sitting alone in my room as a kid, trying to find ways to respond to your overwhelming parental logic) and so when I heard that you were leaning towards voting for Donald Trump, I felt inclined to put my thoughts down so they would be clear.\nIt's fitting that I would write to you here anyway, because the Observer has its own father issues when it comes to Donald Trump (Mr. Trump is the publisher\u2019s father-in-law.) This is a newspaper that, despite its sincere and passionate reporting on anti-Semitism and its frontline investigations on the rise of Russia as a national security threat, has found itself endorsing and defending Trump...even as he veers dangerously towards courting anti-Semitism and justifying Russia\u2019s authoritarian methods (when he isn\u2019t complimenting the tactics of Saddam Hussein.) Having been associated with my own fair share of controversial people, I empathize with the position, Jared Kushner, the paper\u2019s owner, must be in.\nI get that elections are complicated. Yet I cannot help but feel that the right choice has become increasingly simple. Not easy, but simple.\nThe choice is simple because it\u2019s hard for me to think of a single person who violates more of what you taught me as a child. The case against Donald Trump as a candidate\u2014even as a person worthy of two seconds of anyone\u2019s serious attention in our busy lives\u2014is clear to me precisely because of what I learned from you, Dad.\nI remember the trips we took to Angel Island in the San Francisco Bay. This is where people like Grandma and Grandpa first arrived in America, you told us. It was here that they stopped on their way to the American Dream, fleeing the terror of their homeland and hoping for a better life. You taught us that it was honorable and brave to be an immigrant and that what made America special was that we opened our arms to these people. Do you remember taking us to the Civil War battlefields and explaining how many of the men who fought and died in that war were fresh off the boat, paying for their citizenship to this country in blood\u2014dying to eradicate the scourge of slavery, a plague they had nothing to do with creating in the first place? That was what made America great, you said.\nBut you didn\u2019t just teach us to admire white European immigrants either. It was from you that I learned to respect just how hard Latino, Asian, and Middle Eastern immigrants worked to make a life for themselves here. You told me what it was like picking fruit in the California heat, and explained how they took jobs that other people weren\u2019t willing to do\u2014because they wanted to support their families just like everyone else. You also took the time to explain how many immigrants were entrepreneurs\u2014starting restaurants and small businesses from donut shops to car dealerships (we\u2019ve invested together in a few of those small businesses) and how their efforts made the world better for everyone.\nWhen I was in Austria a few years ago, I called Mom and had her do some research to find the location of the refugee camp that Grandpa was sent to when he was just a little younger than I am now. It\u2019s an apartment complex now, which I guess goes to show how quickly we can forget the kind of thinking that creates such horrors. Experiences like these\u2014they color the way I see the world, which is why, I imagine, you encouraged us to travel and study history. Those trips are why I find it so repulsive to hear Donald Trump talk about how Mexicans are \u201crapists\u201d and how his solution is building a literal wall\u2014 \u201cWe\u2019re going to have a big, beautiful wall that nobody\u2019s crossing\u201d\u2014to keep these kinds of people out. I find it disgusting to hear him talk about banning Muslims from America. That\u2019s not what you taught me. That\u2019s not how this country is supposed to work. Mom and half our relatives wouldn\u2019t be here if it was.\nI told you that a few weeks ago we had someone out at the house to repair some damage from the floods. As I was walking the property with the guy, he asked me if I owned a gun. I said that I did\u2014this is Texas after all. \u201cGood,\u201d he said, \u201cyou\u2019ll need to have something when them sand niggers come and try to take this country from us.\u201d Then he told me about how he was glad Donald Trump was speaking the truth and taking things in the right direction.\nI know you don\u2019t agree with this man. And I don\u2019t think it\u2019s fair to hold a candidate accountable for every fringe group that attaches themselves to their platform. But doesn\u2019t it alarm you to see a candidate who seems to stoke these kinds of fires\u2014directly or indirectly? Surely you must be shaking your head at Trump\u2019s repeated refusal to distance himself from these people.\nAs a police officer, you worked for a time in the hate crimes division. You\u2019ve seen the horrible things that prejudice and ignorance can do. I remember you once told me that the way the Ku Klux Klan recruited people in our hometown was by convincing white people that they were being attacked and that their way of life was under siege. C\u2019mon Dad, is that not eerily similar to some of Trump\u2019s campaign tactics? Why else would he have refused to immediately disavow the support of David Duke and other white supremacists? What possible purpose did he have to insinuate that President Obama was a Muslim, that he was not born in America? Or question a Mexican-American judge\u2019s loyalty to the law and to the Constitution?\nA few years ago, Donald Trump went on live television and talked about nice his daughter Ivanka\u2019s body was, saying how if he wasn\u2019t her father, he\u2019d probably be dating her. It was disturbing then, but we all say things that come off utterly differently than intended. Except last year, speaking to a Rolling Stone reporter, Trump said the exact same thing again. \u201cYeah, she's really something, and what a beauty, that one,\u201d he told the journalist. \u201cIf I weren't happily married and, ya know, her father...\u201d\nYou have a daughter (and now a daughter-in-law). Can you imagine saying anything like that about them? What would you say to one of your friends who uttered something half that creepy? You\u2019ve been married for thirty years. You taught me about respecting women, about the importance of marriage and fidelity. This man, he doesn\u2019t stand for any of that. On the contrary, he refers to women he doesn\u2019t like as \u201cfat pigs\u201d and \u201cdogs.\u201d He attacks them and when they press him on the issues, says it\u2019s because they\u2019re probably menstruating.\nYou\u2019ve protected presidents and other heads of state as part of your job. Can you imagine any of them behaving that way? I remember our family trip to the White House in middle school\u2014even though you disagreed with the man who was President, you spoke of the office with such reverence and dignity that we felt honored just to visit. I left that day with exactly the sense of admiration and respect for the office that I think you hoped we\u2019d feel. I remember another trip to New York where we walked by the Trump Tower. What\u2019s that, I asked? You just shook your head and said, \u201cTacky.\u201d\nBefore he died, Grandad gave me his copy of John McCain\u2019s memoir Faith of My Fathers and said that I might like to read it. It wasn\u2019t until years later that I got around to it. Did you know that when John McCain was trapped in that horrible North Vietnamese prison, his captors offered to let him go several times? McCain\u2019s father was the commander of all US forces in the Vietnam theater and the Vietcong thought by giving his son an easy way out, they could show that Americans were cowards. Despite the repeated torture that he\u2019d already undergone, despite the fact that McCain ached to go home, he refused. He stayed because he refused to embarrass his country or abandon his comrades\u2014death was better than dishonor. I think that\u2019s the kind of lesson that Grandad was trying to pass along to me. I know you voted for McCain in 2000 and in 2008 in part for that very reason. I don\u2019t agree with many of McCain\u2019s politics but I hope that when tested, I could exhibit one iota of the courage that that man has.\nAnd yet here we are discussing a Republican candidate who insulted John McCain in front of the entire world\u2014claiming that John McCain isn\u2019t a hero because he was captured and spent time in a POW camp. Donald Trump, who got out of serving with a series of draft deferments, said he only likes the veterans \u201cthat weren\u2019t captured.\u201d That this pathetic encounter has been nearly forgotten in the campaign is not because Donald addressed it or apologized, but rather because nearly every day since he either said something worse or piled on with some other obscene gesture or gaffe.\nWouldn\u2019t just a single one of these remarks have run a candidate out of the race in a normal election cycle? Wouldn\u2019t have these repeated and ridiculous lapses in judgement effectively end the campaign for anyone in any election anywhere in the civilized world? I\u2019ve tried to think about why we\u2019ve been so forgiving of Donald Trump. Is it because his opponent is a woman? Does it say something about us? Have we all collectively lost our sense of where the line is and we\u2019re just hoping that someone will finally draw it for us?\nI realize that most of these issues I\u2019ve brought up are personal ones, but isn\u2019t all politics personal? That\u2019s a lesson I learned from you, too. I remember asking whether you supported the Republican or the Democrat candidate in some local election when I was a kid, having heard some friends\u2019 parents talking about it. You told me that people got too caught up in party affiliation and that what really mattered was character and whether you could work together with the person (and whether they could do the job). That\u2019s how I\u2019ve tried to think all my life. I\u2019m thinking about it now that it really matters.\nThe baffling reality is that when it comes to Trump, it\u2019s difficult to critique him on much besides his personality and (lack of) character\u2014because that is all there is. Maybe you can make an exception for some of these comments, I\u2019ve certainly said dumb things before. We all have. Maybe we chalk them up to media mischaracterizations as some of the Trump supporters I know have (given what I write about in this column, I\u2019m the last one to think the media is completely fair or trustworthy). But even making allowances for that, I know for a fact, no matter what the talking heads on TV are trying to tell moderate conservatives, is that you and he stand very far apart on most of the economic principles and civil policies in which you have always believed.\nI remember long trips in the car and the conversation we had about civics and governance. The basics you taught me about the free market, about capitalism, about the government staying out of people\u2019s business. Now that I\u2019m an adult, I\u2019ve come to fully understand and truly appreciate why you taught me these lessons. I see how they\u2019ve contributed to my own success. I also see how the few policies or firm beliefs Trump might actually have fly in the face of all of them.\nBesides repeatedly donating money to Democratic (and Republican) candidates from whom he tried to get favors, Donald Trump has said publicly that there should be \u201csome form of punishment\u201d for women who get abortions (though he later backtracked under pressure). He\u2019s advocated economic policies that the experts say will start trade wars with China and Mexico. He cheered Brexit because it might drive traffic to his Scottish golf courses (the definition of a conflict of interest), has hinted at using federal resources to go after personal enemies like Jeff Bezos, admits he would continue to let his children run his numerous international businesses while in office, supports \u201copening up\u201d our libel laws to reduce freedom of the press, and apparently believes that global warming is a lie created by China.\nI suppose it would be one thing if these beliefs came from some unique ideological framework but we both know they don\u2019t. He\u2019s a man who reacts, a man who speaks before he thinks (something you always taught me to avoid). These aren\u2019t the meticulously crafted positions of an educated leader surrounded by qualified and informed policy experts\u2014as Trump famously said, he advises himself. There is a quote I read from Winston Churchill recently. During World War One, someone asked why he was reading the work of a certain anti-war poet. \u201cI am not a bit afraid of Siegfried Sassoon,\u201d Churchill said, \u201cThat man can think. I am only afraid of people who cannot think.\u201d\nI think that\u2019s why I am so scared, Dad. That\u2019s why I am writing you this letter. I don\u2019t think this man has done a lick of thinking in years\u2014except about himself and the irrational prejudices and fears which rule his increasingly erratic and bizarre life.\nIf my understanding of where you sit it is correct, you are inclined to agree with most of the criticisms I've just made and yet are swayed by very few of them. As is true for a lot of Americans, I know you\u2019ve been disturbed with a lot what Trump has said and wish sincerely that someone else was running in his place. The problem is\u2014the reason you can\u2019t help but feel pressure to give him the benefit of the doubt or vote for him reluctantly\u2014is that you feel a profound and real distrust towards Hillary Clinton.\nI wasn\u2019t old enough to experience the anger and disillusionment that the Clintons brought to the White House. I get the sense that you see them as thoughtless, careless self-aggrandizers who believe themselves to be above the law. Given the evidence, this is a more than fair assessment. You have real, negative experiences with the last administration and the vague memories of the scandals and noise of that era probably makes another four years seem unappealing. I get it.\nIt was J.K. Galbraith who said that politics was a matter of choosing between the disastrous and the unpalatable. I don\u2019t disagree with you we are dealing with less than ideal options. But surely, unpalatable is better than disastrous.\nThen again, no one is saying you have to vote for Hillary. I\u2019m just asking if you could not vote for Donald Trump. Vote for a third party candidate. For a write-in, you could take a page from Trump\u2019s people, who when they initially had trouble finding people to speak on his behalf at the convention, apparently just put \u201cGeorge Washington\u201d in as a placeholder. Or, what about just not voting in this election? Is that not a powerful statement in its own right? One does not need to endorse disaster just because they resent unpalatable.\nMitt Romney has said that he was finally motivated to get involved in this election when his son asked him, \u201cWhen the grandkids ask \u2018What did you do to stop Donald Trump?\u2019 what are you going to say?\u2019\u201d\nI was so happy to be able to tell you a few weeks ago that you have your first grandchild on the way and that he\u2019s expected to arrive just three days before the election. I think that\u2019s why I am writing this letter too, as my way of asking myself what am I going to do to make sure the world he enters is just a little bit better than the one I came into thirty years ago. I guess I am writing this letter to ask that you, as his grandfather, do what you can to ensure the same.\nSo that when he does ask, not that many years in the future, looking back at what was hopefully just a painful aberration in this nation\u2019s history, we both have a good answer to how we faced this challenge in front of us. And that we acted\u2014despite any personal feelings, or complications or doubts\u2014with principle and courage.\nDad, please don\u2019t vote for Donald Trump. Everything you've taught me about what is wrong in the world is everything that man represents. And if you won't do it for me, do it for your grandchild. Give him something to be proud of\u2014and thankful for.\nYour Loving Son,\nRyan\nRyan Holiday is the best-selling author of Ego is the Enemy and three other books.

His name has been so obscured and forgotten by history that he makes an underappreciated general like George Marshall seem positively famous. At least they named the Marshall Plan after George.\nAs Rome\u2019s highest ranking commander under the Byzan\u00adtine emperor Justinian, Belisarius saved Western civilization on at least three occasions. As Rome collapsed and the seat of the empire moved to Constantinople, Belisarius was the only bright light in a dark time for Christianity. Chances are, you haven\u2019t even heard of him.\nAll the same, the man won brilliant victories at Dara, Carthage, Naples, Sic\u00adily, and Constantinople. He saved the emperor\u2019s life when it was threatened by a riotous mob. He reclaimed farflung territories and recaptured Rome for the first time since it fell\u200a\u2014\u200aall before he was 40.\nHis thanks? He was not given public thanks or celebrations. Instead, he was repeatedly second guessed by the emperor and at the end of his illustrious career, Belisarius was stripped of his wealth, and according to the legend, blinded, and forced to beg in the streets to survive.\nHistorians, scholars, and artists have lamented and argued about this treatment for centuries. They\u2019re rightfully outraged at the ungratefulness, and the pettiness this great and unusual man was subjected to. But guess who never complained about it, even when he had the chance? Belisarius.\nIt seems that he was content to simply do his job. That he took pride in doing it well. And that was enough.\nFor Belisarius, this attitude came from a sense of Christian duty which allowed him to put up with the difficulties inherent in his position. Today, while we hope not to be exposed to this kind of preposterously unjust treatment whether at the hands of our bosses, colleagues or government, we nevertheless must understand that thriving in the real world\u200a\u2014\u200aespecially the creative world\u200a\u2014\u200awill require a similar mindset. Not a religious devotion, but a commitment to the work, as opposed to the rewards.\nThough obvious, we often forget that when we work on a project\u200a\u2014\u200awhetherit\u2019s a book or a business or otherwise\u200a\u2014\u200aat a certain point, that thing leaves our hands and enters the realm of the world. It is judged, received, and acted on by other people (whether they are called audiences, bosses, clients, critics, customers or judges). Their response is outside our control.\nIn other words, even if we do everything right, the reaction might be failure, disrespect, jealousy, or even a resounding yawn from the world. If we are motivated by the wrong thing\u200a\u2014\u200aif ego holds sway\u200a\u2014\u200athis response will crush us.\nI\u2019ve seen it happen a hundred times. I\u2019ve done it myself too.\nBelisarius could win his battles. He could lead his men. He could determine his personal ethics. He could not make the Emperor like and appreciate him. He had no ability to control whether a powerful dicta\u00adtor would treat him well.\nThe same is true for our work. How we respond to this dilemma determines who we are as people as well as the quality of what we will create.\nCan we do the right thing even if it\u2019s not recognized? Will we work hard for something that can be taken away from us? Will we lash out and be wronged just because someone else doesn\u2019t play by the rules?\nI released my book two weeks ago. I sold more copies than I ever expected to sell\u200a\u2014\u200athat\u2019s a good thing. Yet I did not appear on the New York TimesBestseller List (despite rightfully earning a place there) or the Wall Street Journal Bestseller List (where my book should have been number one). Why did this happen? I\u2019m not sure.\nI do know that there are certain games it is possible to play with the list and I chose not to play them. I know that I might have done something that pissed the New York Times off a few years ago\u200a\u2014\u200amaybe they\u2019re still mad about it. I also know that my publisher messed some reporting stuff up that might have impacted my chances on one of the lists. (I did hit the nationalUSA Today list and a few other international lists).\nIn any case, I did all the right things. I wrote the book. I hustled my ass off. I didn\u2019t cheat. And the reward?\nI was screwed over and deprived of something that was mine\u200a\u2014\u200athat would be very good for my career.\nExcept that is a preposterously selfish and short sighted way to look at it. First off, because I actually achieved the thing that the list is supposed to recognize (selling well). In fact, I sold more than I expected to sell, reached a lot of people, and got recognized in some places but not others. But those are not things to take pride in. It\u2019s better to find satisfaction in knowing that I wrote the best book that I was capable of writing. Knowing that I pushed myself continually through the process and emerged better for it. Those are two things that were entirely in my control. If my happiness was dependent on everything else going my way, then I would not only be a hypocrite, but a miserable person most of the time.\nI\u2019m not saying that it\u2019s easy to think this way. I\u2019m not saying that I haven\u2019t had to struggle with my anger about it a dozen times since I first found out. But what else am I going to do? Throw a tantrum? Where will that get me?\nWe need to cultivate the humility and discipline necessary to accept that we have only minimal control over the rewards for our work and effort\u200a\u2014\u200aother people\u2019s validation, recognition, rewards.\nThink of all the activists who will find that they can only advance their cause so far. The leaders who are assassinated before their work is done. The inventors whose ideas lan\u00adguish \u201cahead of their time.\u201d According to society\u2019s main metrics, these people were not rewarded for their work. Should they have not done it? Should they not be kind, not work hard, not produce, because there is a chance it wouldn\u2019t be reciprocated? Should they have done the wrong thing instead?\nC\u2019mon.\nYet in our most egotistical and wounded moments\u200a\u2014\u200awhen struggling with our earsplitting \u201cexpectation hangover\u201d\u200a\u2014\u200aevery one of us has considered doing pre\u00adcisely that. Wanted to say: \u201cFuck \u2019em, they don\u2019t appreciate me anyway.\u201d\nIt might feel good in the short term, but it\u2019s awful in the long term.\nIt\u2019s far better (and more resilient) when doing good work is sufficient. When fulfilling our own standards is what fills us with pride and self respect. When the effort\u200a\u2014\u200anot the results, good or bad\u200a\u2014\u200ais enough.\nIt calls to mind the encounter between Alexander the Great and the famous Cynic philosopher Diogenes. Allegedly, Alexander approached Diogenes, who was lying down, enjoying the summer air, and stood over him and asked what he, the most powerful man in the world, might be able to do for this notoriously poor man. Diogenes could have asked for anything. What he requested was epic: \u201cStop blocking my sun.\u201d Even two thousand years later we can feel exactly where in the solar plexus that must have hit Alexander, a man who always wanted to prove how important he was. As the author Robert Louis Stevenson later observed about this meeting, \u201cIt is a sore thing to have labored along and scaled arduous hilltops, and when all is done, find humanity indifferent to your achievement.\u201d\nWe need to try for that as well. Because maybe our parents will never be impressed. Maybe our girlfriend won\u2019t care. Maybe the investor won\u2019t see the numbers. Maybe the audi\u00adence won\u2019t clap. But we have to be able to push through. We can\u2019t let that be what motivates us.\nHow do you carry on then? How do you take pride in yourself and your work? John Wooden\u2019s advice to his players says it: Change the definition of success. \u201cSuccess is peace of mind, which is a direct result of self satisfaction in knowing you made the effort to do your best to become the best that you are capable of becoming.\u201d \u201cAmbition,\u201d Marcus Aurelius reminded himself, \u201cmeans tying your well\u00adbeing to what other people say or do . . . Sanity means tying it to your own actions.\u201d In other words: Do your work. Do it well. Let that be the end of your concern.\nAnd understand, that even so\u200a\u2014\u200athere will be times when you will be unappreciated. You will be sabotaged. You will experience surprising failures. Your expectations will not be met. You will lose. You will fail.\nRecognition and rewards\u200a\u2014\u200athose must be extra. John Kennedy Toole\u2019s great book A Confederacy of Dunces was universally turned down by publishers, news that so broke his heart that he later committed suicide in his car on an empty road in Biloxi, Mississippi. After his death, his mother discovered the book, advocated on its behalf until it was published, and it eventually won the Pulitzer Prize.\nThink about that for a second. What changed between those submissions? Nothing. The book was the same. It was equally great when Toole had it in manuscript form and had fought with editors about it as it was when the book was published, sold copies, and won awards. If only he could have realized this, it would have saved him so much heart\u00adbreak. He couldn\u2019t, but from his painful example we can at least see how arbitrary many of the breaks in life are.\nThis is why we are the only people who should define what success looks like\u200a\u2014\u200aand that that success should not depend on externals. It should be on us.\nThe world is, after all, indifferent to what we humans \u201cwant.\u201d What can go wrong will. If we persist in wanting, in needing that to not happen?\nOnly misery and disappointment awaits.\nBut if we can find joy and satisfaction in the work? Well that can be ours right now.\nRyan Holiday is the bestselling author of Ego is the Enemy and three other books.

They said: \u201cJust make your boss look good.\u201d\nNow in Hollywood, a world of big egos obsessed with getting credit, there is really no other way for someone just starting out to survive. But it turns out that across industries and across history,aspiring young men and women have used this same approach to get ahead.\nThey realized that the best way to advance their own interests was to do something simple but counterintuitive: provide opportunities for other people. Not only because it makes their boss look good, but because it creates its own opportunities for the pupil to learn and explore.\nFor instance, many people know that as a young man Benjamin Franklin published numerous letters written under fake names like Silence Dogwood. What they don\u2019t know is that Franklin wrote those letters, sub\u00admitted them by sliding them under the print\u00adshop door, and received absolutely no credit for them until much later in his life. In fact, it was his brother, the owner, who profited from their immense popularity, regularly running them on the front page of his newspaper. Franklin was playing the long game, though \u2014 learning how public opinion worked, generating awareness of what he believed in, crafting his style and tone and wit. It was a strategy he used time and again over his career \u2014 once even publishing in his compet\u00aditor\u2019s paper in order to undermine a third competitor \u2014 for Franklin saw the constant benefit in making other people look good and letting them take credit for his ideas.\nOne must master their ego to be able to completely ignore getting credit, getting ahead, even throwing out what your job is supposed to be on paper. It takes a special type of humility to focus your energy on finding, presenting, and facilitating opportunities that help other people succeed.\nBut this is essential.\nBill Belichick, the now four-time Super Bowl-winning coach of the New England Patriots, made his way up the ranks of the NFL by loving and mastering how to do the one thing that coaches hated at the time: analyzing film.\nHis first job in professional football for the Baltimore Colts was one he volunteered to take without pay \u2014 and his insights, which provided ammunition and critical strategies for the game, were attributed exclusively to the other public-facing coaches.  \u201cHe was like a sponge, tak\u00ading it all in, listening to everything,\u201d one coach said. \u201cYou gave him an assignment and he disappeared into a room and you didn\u2019t see him again until it was done, and then he wanted to do more,\u201d said another.\nThis gave him two things: first, a role in the organization that allowed him to thrive and carve out space for himself, two, an understanding of the game that today cannot be matched. And today, Beli\u00adchick has no problem getting paid.\nA few years ago there was some controversy because Sheryl Sandberg, the COO of Facebook, was looking for an unpaid intern. How dare she?! bloggers shouted and yelled. She can afford to pay! Of course, she could. But can you afford to pass on that opportunity?\nThe attitude of the angry, unappreciated genius\u2014that gets us nowhere. Nowhere but living back at home with our parents because \u201cwe\u2019re overqualified\u201d for an entry-level position. Nowhere but a reputation for being a person who doesn\u2019t work well with others, who is entitled and obnoxious.\nMeanwhile, the apprenticeship model is responsible for some of the greatest art in the history of the world\u2014everyone from Michelangelo to Leonardo da Vinci to Benjamin Franklin has been forced to navigate such a system. The greatest networkers in the world practice their art by delivering extraordinary amounts of value to everyone they meet.\nIt\u2019s because they realize what most people\u2019s ego\u2019s prevent them from seeing: that by serving and helping others now, you\u2019re really helping yourself.\nI\u2019ve seen this in my own life. For many years, I was a research assistant and apprentice for the author Robert Greene, creator of the 48 Laws of Power. My job was to contribute little bits and pieces to his books that 99% of the public would have no idea I was responsible for. But I loved it. I did it for years.\nWorking in that system, also taught me the fatal consequences of ego. One slip up, one false belief that you were indispensable to the project, and the door would be shut on you. Important people don\u2019t have time for that. But the quieter and more helpful I could be? The more opportunities I had to contribute. The more I learned. The more trust I was given.\nSlowly I developed my own abilities and was able to pursue my own career. I\u2019m writing this article (and now my own books) because of it.\nThere is an old saying, \u201cSay little, do much.\u201d What we really ought to do is update and apply a version of that to our early approach. Be lesser, do more. Imagine if for every person you met, you thought of some way to help them, something you could do for them? And you looked at it in a way that entirely benefited them and not you. The cumu\u00adlative effect this would have over time would be profound: You\u2019d learn a great deal by solving diverse problems. You\u2019d develop a reputation for being indispensable. You\u2019d have countless new relationships. You\u2019d have an enormous bank of favors to call upon down the road.\nThat\u2019s what this strategy is about \u2014 helping yourself by helping others. Making a concerted effort to trade your short\u00ad term gratification for a longer\u00adterm payoff. Whereas everyone else wants to get credit and be \u201crespected,\u201d you can forget credit. You can forget it so hard that you\u2019re glad when others get it instead of you \u2014 that was your aim, after all. Consider it all an investment.\nThis approach is here for you at anytime. There is no expiration date on it either. It\u2019s one of the few that age does not limit \u2014 on either side, young or old. You can start at any time \u2014 before you have a job, before you\u2019re hired and while you\u2019re doing something else, or if you\u2019re starting something new or find yourself inside an organization with\u00adout strong allies or support. You may even find that there\u2019s no reason to ever stop doing it, even once you\u2019ve graduated to heading your own projects. Let it become natural and permanent \u2014 always, always find opportunities for other people.\nThis piece is adapted from the book Ego is the Enemy, published by Penguin/Portfolio.\nRyan Holiday is the bestselling author of Ego Is The Enemy and three other books.

Stuck in a job we don\u2019t like. Stuck across town because a meeting was cancelled. Stuck with an obligation that someone else signed us up for. Stuck in a failing company. \nWe\u2019re stuck\u2014we don\u2019t have a choice about that. But we do have a choice about something else: What will we do with this time? \nIn 1946, Malcolm X was sentenced to 10 years in prison. Even accounting for the shameful American racism and whatever systematic legal injustices existed at the time, Mal\u00adcolm X was guilty. He deserved to go to jail. And now he had roughly a decade to sit in a cage. \nAs Malcolm X entered that prison he faced that same choice. He faced what Robert Greene\u2014a man who sixty years later would find his wildly popular books banned in many federal prisons\u2014calls an \u201cAlive Time or Dead Time\u201d scenario. How would the seven years he would serve play out? What would Malcolm do with this time?                                \nAccording to Greene, there are two types of time in our lives: dead time, when people are passive and waiting, and alive time, when people are learning and acting and utiliz\u00ading every second. Every moment of failure, every moment or situation that we did not deliberately choose or control, presents this choice: Alive time. Dead time.\nWhich will it be?\nMalcolm chose alive time. He began to learn. He explored religion. He taught himself to be a reader by checking out a pencil and the dictionary from the prison library and not only consumed it from start to finish, but copied it down long\u2010hand from cover to cover. All these words he\u2019d never known existed before were transferred to his brain. \nAs he said later, \u201cFrom then until I left that prison, in every free moment I had, if I was not reading in the library, I was reading in my bunk.\u201d He read history, he read sociol\u00adogy, he read about religion, he read the classics, he read philosophers like Kant and Spinoza. Later, a reporter asked Malcolm, \u201cWhat\u2019s your alma mater?\u201d His one word answer: \u201cBooks.\u201d\nPrison became his college. He transcended confine\u00adment through the pages he absorbed. He reflected that months passed without him even thinking about being detained against his will. He had \u201cnever been so truly free in his life.\u201d \nAnd yet, here we are, stuck in our own way. Maybe you\u2019re sitting in a remedial high school class, maybe you\u2019re watching for the numbers to come in on your newest launch, maybe it\u2019s a trial separation, maybe you\u2019re stuck making smoothies or living at home while you save up money, maybe you\u2019re stuck waiting out a contract or a tour of duty. Maybe this situation is one totally of your own making, or perhaps it\u2019s just bad luck. \nThe ego in all of us wants to complain about how this situation sucks. How it\u2019s unfair. How we\u2019d rather be doing just about anything else. And it\u2019s this attitude that creates dead time we can never get back. In this way, ego is the mortal enemy of alive time. \nBut if we\u2019re humble, accepting and creative, we can transform seemingly terrible situations\u2014a prison sentence, a dysfunctional job, a bear market or depression, military conscription, a failing company\u2014 turned those circumstances into fuel for greatness.   \nWe can ask ourselves: What can I accomplish here? What can I do with this time? Think of what you have been putting off. Issues you declined to deal with. Systemic problems that felt too over\u00adwhelming to address. Dead time is revived when we use it as an opportunity to do what we\u2019ve long needed to do\u2014from having difficult conversations to squeezing in some quiet reading time. \nFrancis Scott Key wrote the poem that became the national anthem of the United States while trapped on a ship during a prisoner exchange in the War of 1812. Viktor Frankl refined his psychologies of meaning and suffering during his ordeal in three Nazi concentration camps. Not that these opportunities always come in such serious situa\u00adtions. The author Ian Fleming was on bed rest and, per doc\u00adtors\u2019 orders, forbidden from using a typewriter. They were worried he\u2019d exert himself by writing another Bond novel. So he created Chitty-Chitty-Bang-Bang: The Magical Car by hand instead. Walt Disney made his decision to become a cartoonist while laid up after stepping on a rusty nail. \n\u201cMany a serious thinker has been produced in prisons,\u201d as Robert Greene put it, \u201cwhere we have nothing to do but think.\u201d Well, at the very least, our situation can be used for that. To get some serious thinking done.\nIt\u2019s easy to angry, to be aggrieved, to be depressed or heartbroken. I don\u2019t want this. I want ______. I want it my way. But this accomplishes nothing!\nAs they say, this moment is not your life. But it is a moment in your life. How will you use it? \nLet us say, the next time we find ourselves stuck: This is an opportunity for me. I am using it for my purposes. I will not let this be dead time for me. The dead time was when we were controlled by ego. \nAs Booker T. Washington most famously put it, \u201cCast down your bucket where you are.\u201d Make use of what\u2019s around you. Even the dead time. Because while its occurrence isn\u2019t in our control. Its use, on the other hand, is. \nThis piece is adapted from Ryan Holiday\u2019s book Ego is the Enemy, published by Penguin Portfolio                                                           \nRyan Holiday is the bestselling author of Ego Is The Enemy and three other books.

He didn\u2019t focus on the buzzer beater. Or the strategy. He said his team won because \u201cthey followed the process.\u201d\nTony Wroten, a guard for the 76ers, got the same advice from his coaches. \u201cThey tell us every game, every day, \u2018trust the process.\u2019\u201d John Fox, the coach trying to turn around the Chicago Bears, asked his team the same thing.\nBut what the hell is it? What is the process?\nIt can be traced to Nick Saban, the famous coach of LSU and Alabama\u2014perhaps the most dominant dynasty in the history of college football. But he got it from a psychiatry professor named Lionel Rosen during his time at Michigan State.\nRosen\u2019s big insight was this: sports\u2014especially football\u2014are complex. Nobody has enough brainpower or motivation to consistently manage all the variables going on in the course of a season, let alone a game. They think they do\u2014but realistically, they don\u2019t.\nThere are too many plays, too many players, too many statistics, countermoves, unpredictables, distractions. Over the course of a long playoff season, this adds up into a cognitively impossible load. Meanwhile, as Monte Burke writes in his book Saban, Rosen discovered that the average play in football lasts just seven seconds. Seven seconds\u2014that\u2019s very manageable.\n  Nick Saban, head coach of the Alabama Crimson Tide (Photo by Rodger Mallison/Fort Worth Star-Telegram/TNS via Getty Images)\nSo he posed a question: What if a team concentrated only on what they could manage? What if they took things step by step\u2014not focusing on anything but what was right in front of them and on doing it well?\nAs a result, Nick Saban doesn\u2019t focus on what every other coach focuses on, or at least not the way they do. He tells them:\n\u201cDon\u2019t think about winning the SEC Championship. Don\u2019t think about the national championship. Think about what you needed to do in this drill, on this play, in this moment. That\u2019s the process: Let\u2019s think about what we can do today, the task at hand.\u201d\nIt\u2019s this message that\u2019s been internalized by his players and his teams\u2014which together have four national championships in an eight-year span, one Mid-American Conference championship, have been crowned SEC champions 15 times and Saban has received multiple coaching awards.\nIn the chaos of sport, as in life, process provides a way. A way to turn something very complex into something simple. Not that simple is easy.\nBut it is easier. Let\u2019s say you\u2019ve got to do something difficult. Don\u2019t focus on that. Instead break it down into pieces. Simply do what you need to do right now. And do it well. And then move on to the next thing. Follow the process and not the prize. As Bill Belichick famously put it, just do your job.\nThe road to back-to-back championships, or being a writer or a successful entrepreneur is just that, a road. And you travel along a road in steps. Excellence is a matter of steps. Excelling at this one, then that one and then the one after that. Saban\u2019s process is exclusively this\u2014existing in the present, taking it one step at a time, not getting distracted by anything else. Not the other team, not the scoreboard, or the crowd.\nThe process is about finishing. Finishing games. Finishing workouts. Finishing film sessions. Finishing drives. Finishing reps. Finishing plays. Finishing blocks. Finishing the smallest task you have right in front of you and finishing it well.\nWhether it\u2019s pursuing the pinnacle of success in your field, or simply surviving some awful or trying ordeal, the same approach works. Don\u2019t think about the end\u2014think about surviving. Getting it right from meal to meal, meeting to meeting, project to project, paycheck to paycheck, one day at a time.\nAnd when you really get it right, even the hardest things become manageable. As Heraclitus observed, \u201cunder the comb, the tangle and the straight path are the same.\u201d That\u2019s what the process is. Under its influence, we needn\u2019t panic. Even mammoth tasks become just a series of component parts.\nThis was what the great 19th-century pioneer of meteorology, James Pollard Espy, had shown to him in a chance encounter as a young man. Unable to read and write until he was 18, Espy attended a rousing speech by the famous orator Henry Clay. After the talk, a spellbound Espy tried to make his way toward Clay, but he couldn\u2019t form the words to speak to his idol. One of his friends shouted out for him: \u201cHe wants to be like you, even though he can\u2019t read.\u201d\nClay grabbed one of his posters, which had the word CLAY written in big letters. He looked at Espy and said, \u201cYou see that, boy?\u201d pointing to a letter. \u201cThat\u2019s an A. Now, you\u2019ve only got 25 more letters to go.\u201d\nEspy had just been gifted The Process. Within a year, he started college.\nWhat Rosen, what Espy, what these coaches are practicing is a central tenet of stoic philosophy\u2014one which I\u2019ve tried to pass along in The Obstacle is The Way. It\u2019s just a modern take on Marcus Aurelius when he advised:\n\u201cDon\u2019t let your imagination be crushed by life as a whole. Don\u2019t try to picture everything bad that could possibly happen. Stick with the situation at hand, and ask, \u201cWhy is this so unbearable? Why can\u2019t I endure it?\u201d\nStatue of the Roman emperor Marcus Aurelius (Photo: Getty Images)\nSeven seconds. Sticking to the situation at hand. Focusing on what\u2019s immediately in front of you. No strain, no struggling. So relaxed. No exertion or worry. Just one simple movement after another. That\u2019s the power of process.\nWe can channel this, too. We needn\u2019t scramble like we\u2019re so often inclined to do when some difficult task sits in front of us. Instead, we can take a breath, do the immediate, composite part in front of us\u2014and follow its thread into the next action. Everything in order, everything connected.\nWhen it comes to our actions, disorder and distraction are death. The unordered mind loses track of what\u2019s in front of it\u2014what matters\u2014and gets distracted by thoughts of the future. The process is order, it keeps our perceptions in check and our actions in sync.\nIt seems obvious, but we forget this when it matters most.\nRight now, if I knocked you down and pinned you to ground, how would you respond? You\u2019d probably panic. And then you\u2019d push with all your strength to get me off you. It wouldn\u2019t work; just using my body weight, I would be able to keep your shoulders against the ground with little effort\u2014and you\u2019d grow exhausted fighting it.\nThat\u2019s the opposite of the process.\nThe process is much easier. First, you don\u2019t panic, you conserve your energy. You don\u2019t do anything stupid like get yourself choked out by acting without thinking. You focus on not letting it get worse. Then you get your arms up, to brace and create some breathing room, some space. Now work to get on your side.  From there you can start to break down my hold on you: grab an arm, trap a leg, buck with your hips, slide in a knee.\nIt\u2019ll take some time, but you\u2019ll get yourself out. At each step, the person on top is forced to give a little up, until there\u2019s nothing left. Then you\u2019re free.\nBeing trapped is just a position, not a fate. You get out of it by addressing and eliminating each part of that position through small, deliberate action\u2014not by trying (and failing) to push it away with superhuman strength.\nWith our business rivals, we rack our brains to think of some mind-blowing new product that will make them irrelevant, and, in the process, we take our eye off the ball. We shy away from writing a book or making a film even though it\u2019s our dream because it\u2019s so much work\u2014we can\u2019t imagine how we get from here to there.\nHow often do we compromise or settle because we feel that the real solution is too ambitious or outside our grasp? How often do we assume that change is impossible because it\u2019s too big? Involves too many different groups? Or worse, how many people are paralyzed by all their ideas and inspirations? They chase them all and go nowhere, distracting themselves and never making headway. They\u2019re brilliant, sure, but they rarely execute. They rarely get where they want and need to go.\nAll these issues are solvable. Each would collapse beneath the process. We\u2019ve just wrongly assumed that it has to happen all at once, and we give up at the thought of it. We are A-to-Z thinkers, fretting about A, obsessing over Z, yet forgetting all about B through Y.\nWe want to have goals, yes, so everything we do can be in service of something purposeful. When we know what we\u2019re really setting out to do, the obstacles that arise tend to seem smaller, more manageable. When we don\u2019t, each one looms larger and seems impossible. Goals help put the blips and bumps in proper proportion.\nWhen we get distracted, when we start caring about something other than our own progress and efforts, the process is the helpful, if occasionally bossy, voice in our head. It is the bark of the wise, older leader who knows exactly who he is and what he\u2019s got to do. Shut up. Go back to your stations and try to think about what we are going to do ourselves, instead of worrying about what\u2019s going on out there. You know what your job is, stop jawing and get to work.\nThe process is the voice that demands we take responsibility and ownership. That prompts us to act even if only in a small way.\nLike a relentless machine, subjugating resistance each and every way it exists, little by little. Moving forward, one step at a time. Subordinate strength to the process. Replace fear with the process. Depend on it. Lean on it. Trust in it.\nTake your time, don\u2019t rush. Some problems are harder than others. Deal with the ones right in front of you first. Come back to the others later. You\u2019ll get there.\nThe process is about doing the right things, right now. Not worrying about what might happen later, or the results, or the whole picture.\nRyan Holiday is the best-selling author of The Obstacle Is the Way: The Timeless Art of Turning Trials into Triumph and two other books."}, {"author": "Ryan Holiday", "headline": "The Single Worst Marketing Decision You Can Make", "body": "Make something people want.\n\u2014Paul Graham\nYou know what the single worst marketing decision you can make is? Starting with a product nobody wants or nobody needs.\nYet for years, this was a scenario that marketers tolerated and accepted as part of the job. We all told ourselves that \u201cyou go to market with the product you have, not the one you want.\u201d And then we wondered why our strategies failed\u2014and why those failures were so expensive.\nWhat attracted me to growth hacking from the very start was that it rejects this obviously flawed approach outright. Growth hackers believe that products\u2014even whole businesses and business models\u2014can and should be changed until they are primed to generat explosive reactions from the first people who see them. In other words, the best marketing decision you can make is to have a product or business that fulfills a real and compelling need for a real and defined group of people\u2014no matter how much tweaking and refining this takes.\nTake Airbnb, a start-up now valued at some $10 billion. Today we know it as a site where, as cofounder Brian Chesky put it, \u201cyou can book space anywhere. It can be anything, and it really is anything from a tent to a castle.\u201d But in 2007, the business started as a way for the founders to turn the living room of their loft apartment into a little bed-and-breakfast. The founders named it airbedandbreakfast.com and put out air mattresses on their floor and offered free homemade breakfast to guests. But the founders wanted more.\nGoing back to the drawing board and hoping to capitalize on popular technology and design conferences, the founders repositioned the service as a networking alternative for attendees when hotels were booked up. This was clearly a better market, but the company sensed they could improve the idea further, so they pivoted slightly to target the type of traveler who didn\u2019t want to crash on couches or in hostels but was looking to avoid hotels. This did better still. Finally, based on feedback and usage patterns, they shortened the name to airbnb and abandoned the breakfast and networking parts of the business, redefining the service as a place for people to rent or book any kind of lodging imaginable (from rooms to apartments to trains, boats, castles, penthouses, and private islands). This was explosive\u2014to the tune of millions of bookings a year in locations all over the world.\nAirbnb had a good idea in 2007, but the actual value proposition, if we\u2019re being honest, was a little mediocre. The founders could have spent all their time and energy trying to force the \u201clet people crash on your floor and feed them breakfast\u201d angle and creating a small business around it. Instead, they treated their product and service as something malleable and were able to change and improve it until they found its best iteration. They went from a good but fairly impractical idea to an explosive and practical idea, and then as a result, a billion-dollar valuation. This switch was undoubtedly the best marketing decision they ever could have made.\nAs a traditional marketer, I can think of precisely zero times when we went back to the drawing board after seeing a less-than-stellar response. It wasn\u2019t permitted. Our only move was to put more muscle behind bad products and companies.\nIt was a wake-up call to me to learn that Airbnb was by no means unique: Instagram started as a location-based social network called Burbn (which had an optional photo feature). It attracted a core group of users and more than $500,000 in funding. And yet the founders realized that its users were flocking to only one part of the app\u2014the photos and filters. They had a meeting, which one of the founders recounts like this: \u201cWe sat down and said, \u2018What are we going to work on next? How are we going to evolve this product into something millions of people will want to use? What is the one thing that makes this product unique and interesting?\u2019\"\nThe service soon retooled to become Instagram as we know it: a mobile app for posting photos with filters. The result? One hundred thousand users within a week of relaunching. Within eighteen months, the founders sold Instagram to Facebook for $1 billion.\nI know that seems simple, that the marketing lesson from Instragram is that they made a product that was just awesome. But that\u2019s good news for you\u2014it means there\u2019s no secret sauce, and the second your product gets to be that awesome, you can see similar results. Just look at Snapchat, which essentially followed the same playbook by innovating in the mobile photo app space, blew up with young people, and skyrocketed to a $3.5-billion-dollar valuation with next-to-no marketing.\nSome companies like Airbnb and Instragram spend a long time trying new iterations until they achieve what growth hackers call Product Market Fit (PMF); others find it right away. The end goal is the same, however, and it\u2019s to have the product and its customers in perfect sync with each other. Eric Ries, author of The Lean Startup, explains that the best way to get to Product Market Fit is by starting with a \u201cminimum viable product\u201d and improving it based on feedback\u2014as opposed to what most of us do, which is to try to launch publicly with what we think is our final, perfected product.\nToday, it is the marketer\u2019s job as much as anyone else\u2019s to make sure Product Market Fit happens. Your marketing efforts are wasted on a mediocre product\u2014so don\u2019t tolerate mediocrity. OK?\nBut rather than waiting for it to happen magically or assuming that this is some other department\u2019s job, marketers need to contribute to this process. Isolating who your customers are, figuring out their needs, designing a product that will blow their minds\u2014these are marketing decisions, not just development and design choices.\nThe imperative is clear: stop sitting on your hands and start getting them dirty. Optimizing a product to spread and be well received by customers, by the media, and by influencers is something that you, as a marketer or a growth hacker, are uniquely qualified to do. You are, in effect, the translator who helps bridge the producers and the consumers so they are in alignment.\nAnd this is true whether you\u2019re making some physical gadget, designing a menu, or creating an app. Someone has to be the advocate for the potential market (customers), and the earlier their influence is felt in the process, the better.\nAmazon has actually made this part of their basic procedures. Ian McAllister, general manager at Amazon, calls this approach \u201cworking backwards from the customer.\u201d For new initiatives, employees begin by creating an internal press release that announces this new potential project as though it was just finished. It\u2019s addressed to the customers\u2014whoever they happen to be\u2014and explains how this new offering solves their problems in an exciting or compelling way.\nIf the press release cannot do that, the initiative is tweaked and tweaked and tweaked until it can, according to McAllister, Amazon encourages product managers to think like Oprah\u2014that is, would she rapturously shout about this product if she were giving it away to her fans as a gift?\nThe exercise forces the team to focus on exactly what its potential new product is and what\u2019s special about it. I guarantee that someone with a mind that bends toward growth hacking put this policy into place.\nNo longer content to let the development happen as it happens, we can influence it with input, with rules and guidelines, and with feedback. The growth hacker helps with iterations, advises, and analyzes every facet of the business. In other words, Product Market Fit is a feeling backed with data and information.\nHow Do You Get PMF?\nBecause Product Market Fit can be overwhelming as a technical business concept, allow me to explain it by dropping the jargon and presenting an analogy. As it turns out, I was familiar with PMF long before I read Andrew Chen\u2019s article.\nMuch of the marketing I do is with authors and books. I\u2019ve worked with dozens of bestsellers in the last five years\u2014and, of course, I\u2019ve also worked on many books that weren\u2019t successful. In my experience, the books that tend to flop upon release are those where the author goes into a cave for a year to write it, then hands it off to the publisher for release. They hope for a hit that rarely comes.\nOn the other hand, I have clients who blog extensively before publishing. They develop their book ideas based on the themes that they naturally gravitate toward but that also get the greatest response from readers. (One client sold a book proposal using a screenshot of Google queries to his site.) They test the ideas they\u2019re writing about in the book on their blog and when they speak in front of groups. They ask readers what they\u2019d like to see in the book. They judge topic ideas by how many comments a given post generates, by how many Facebook \u201cshares\u201d an article gets. They put potential title and cover ideas up online to test and receive feedback. They look to see what hot topics other influential bloggers are riding and find ways of addressing them in their book.*\nThe latter achieves PMF; the former never does. One is growth hacking; the other, simply guessing.\nOne is easy for me to market. The other is often a lost cause. One needs only a small shove to get going. The other has a strong headwind every step of the way.\nAmazon, for its part, has a couple of other easy suggestions for you if the advice \u201cwrite a hypothetical press release\u201d doesn\u2019t quite work for your situation. Their CTO, Werner Vogels, suggests trying to write an FAQ for this product you\u2019re developing. (That way you can address, in advance, potential user issues and questions.) Or try to define the crucial parts of the user experience by making mockups of pages, writing hypothetical case studies so you can actually start to see what it would look like and who it would work for and how. Finally, try writing the user manual, which as Werner explains usually has three parts: concepts, how-to, and reference. (Defining these means you understand your idea in and out from the customers perspective. Also, he says, if you have more than one type of user then write multiple manuals.)\nI love those ideas. They might feel like homework, but they force you to imagine your product from someone\u2019s perspective other than your own. That\u2019s the best way to get to PMF\u2014because ultimately this isn\u2019t about you; it\u2019s about the people you\u2019re trying to turn into customers.\nPerhaps you\u2019ll get to PMF with one aha moment like Instagram, or it may be incremental percent improvements. As Marc Andreessen\u2014the entrepreneur behind Netscape, Opsware, and Ning who, in addition to running a major venture capital fund, happens to be on the board of directors for Facebook, eBay, and HP\u2014explains it, companies need to \u201cdo whatever is required to get to product/market fit. Including changing out people, rewriting your product, moving into a different market, telling customers no when you don\u2019t want to, telling customers yes when you don\u2019t want to, raising that fourth round of highly dilutive venture capital\u2014whatever is required.\u201d\nIn other words: everything is now on the table.\nOpen Up to Feedback\nPart of this new approach is having the humility to accept that marketers are not necessarily the most critical members of the team. It\u2019s true. Sometimes the best thing marketers can do is to not let people get distracted by \u201cmarketing\u201d for a minute. Sometimes the outward-facing part of the job is exactly the least important part.\nTake Evernote, a start-up that offers productivity and organization software, which made the companywide decision to delay spending even a penny on marketing for the first several years of its growth. As Evernote\u2019s founder, Phil libin, told a group of entrepreneurs in a now-classic talk, \u201cPeople [who are] thinking about things other than making the best product, never make the best product.\u201d So Evernote took \u201cmarketing\u201d off the table and instead poured that budget into product development. This undoubtedly slowed brand building at first\u2014but it paid off. Why? Because Evernote is far and away the most superior productivity and note-taking application on the planet. Today, it practically markets itself.\nPerhaps this is what you need to do. I know you\u2019re probably reading this book looking for some immediate tips you can put into action\u2014places you can deploy your budget or resources. But let\u2019s think outside the box\u2014 outside the budget\u2014and consider whether improving your product might be the best strategy.\nThat\u2019s not to say you shouldn\u2019t do anything at all. Evernote still came up with a bunch of clever tricks to get people to see its products while marketing was on their strategic back burner. After hearing customers complain that their bosses were suspicious of employees using their laptops in meetings, the Evernote team produced stickers that said, \u201cI\u2019m not being rude. I\u2019m taking notes in Evernote.\u201d Thus, their most loyal customers were turning into billboards that went from meeting to meeting.\nOnce we stop thinking of the products we market as static\u2014that our job as marketers is to simply work with what we\u2019ve got instead of working on and improving what we\u2019ve got\u2014the whole game changes. Now we are not helpless, repeatedly pitching a product to reporters and users that is not resonating. Instead, we use this information to improve the product, with the idea of ultimately refining our idea into something that can in many ways sell itself.\nThe race has changed. The prize and spoils no longer go to the person who makes it to market first. They go to the person who makes it to Product Market Fit first. Because once you get there, your marketing efforts become like a spark applied to a bed of kindling soaked in kerosene. The old way? It\u2019s striking a match...and hoping it starts a fire somewhere.\nThe point is: marketing as we know it is a waste of time without PMF.\nOf course, there are many tools to help get you there. From Google to Optimizely to KISSmetrics, there are great services that allow you to see what your users are actually doing and responding to on your site. This insight will get you closer to a fit than gut instincts ever will.\nBut the most effective method is simply the Socratic method. We must simply and repeatedly question every assumption. Who is this product for? Why would they use it? Why do I use it?\nask your customers questions, too: What is it that brought you to this product? What is holding you back from referring other people to it? What\u2019s missing? What\u2019s golden? Don\u2019t ask random people or your friends\u2014be scientific about it. Use tools like Surveymonkey, Wufoo, Qualaroo, or even Google Docs, which make it very easy to offer surveys to some or all of your customers.\nFor the first time we can ask these questions because we intend to do something about it. No more privately complaining to friends, coworkers, and spouses that we\u2019re stuck with a product nobody wants.\nNot to say that you must use all the data that comes back, but you should have it. The black-box approach is no longer necessary. Change is possible\u2014which means you need to make yourself available and open to it.\nProduct Market Fit is not some mythical status that happens accidentally. Companies work for it; they crawl toward it. They\u2019re ready to throw out weeks or months of\nN work because the evidence supports that decision. The services as their customers know them now are fundamentally different from what they were at launch\u2014before they had Product Market Fit.\nBut once these companies get PMF, they don\u2019t just wait and hope that success will come along on its own. The next step is to bring the customers in.\nRyan Holiday is a media strategist and prominent writer on strategy and business.

Paradoxically, given the nature of its work, this is an area where one would assume that the most compassion in any society should be found. It does not add up. We need to reset our health and care services so they are fit for the 21st century.\nEveryone in Nigeria used to respect doctors and nurses. And why not? These are jobs that are as demanding as they are vital. Healthcare workers were seen as arbiters of life and death, a duty that was held sacred. But the endless cycle of strikes seem to be eroding much of this. While doctors, nurses, and other healthcare workers often have a genuine dissatisfaction with the facilities where they work, accessibility to drugs, and general conditions of service, the core issue at the heart of these strikes has been remuneration and status.\nPerhaps, it is time to expand this conversation beyond healthcare workers and government. Leaving it to healthcare workers and government in the past has only led to \u201ccollective bargaining agreements\u201d (CBAs) for improved wages and conditions of service that have been unsustainable. Government accedes to these collective agreements in the heat of each strike, and it quickly becomes obvious that it cannot fund the agreements, especially when other professions start agitating as well, and then we are back to square one, and a new cycle begins.\nAt the moment, there appears to be only one inevitable trajectory to the situation with strikes; more strikes, which lead to more disruption, which leads to more risks to the professional reputations of doctors and nurses, leading to more loss of public patience, and ultimately, this will inevitably lead to the failure of the public sector healthcare delivery system. Without radical reforms, it is hard to see how the current management arrangement of tertiary hospitals in Nigeria will survive. Just like NEPA and NITEL, we have started our descent.\nWe do not realise the damage done by strikes in our context because no one bothers to count. When junior doctors working in the UK\u2019s National Health Service (NHS) went on strike for two days recently, the first time this was happening in its history, it led to the cancellation of 125,000 operations and appointments. In Nigeria, strikes continue for months, with associated loss of life and income. If we counted the damage done by strikes in Nigeria, there would be widespread outrage.\nPicture credit: Orodata\nThe time has come to have a deeper conversation on the impact of strikes by health care workers on the lives of Nigerians. Nigerians can no longer afford to leave this to the professionals and the government to resolve. The Government is there to represent us, by allocating our common resources to pay health workers to provide care for us. It is time for us to raise our voices and assess how both our government and the healthcare workers employed on our behalf are fulfilling their responsibilities to us.\nIn order to achieve success, and stop this alarming descent, we must urgently commence an Indaba, a conversation process, whose recommendations must lead to implementation, and not be shelved like the many previous ones. We must find some eminent and credible Nigerians to lead this conversation. It will have to be led by someone outside of the key medical professions because of the loss of trust among health sector professionals.  During this Indaba, we must address some of the most fundamental issues facing the sector, which we have chosen to overlook over the years. There are five critical points that we think must be addressed:\nIntroduce accountability into patient-care - There must be a relationship between salaries in public sector hospitals and outcomes. Outcomes have to include both process outcomes, such as numbers of patients seen, clinical outcomes, as well as patient satisfaction. As long as there is no form of accountability in the sector, the only source of motivation to work is healthcare workers\u2019 altruism, which unfortunately is not sufficient in our context.\nUnderstand the appropriate doctor/nurse to patient ratio appropriate for each department in our tertiary hospitals - The situation at the moment where a single tertiary hospital has upwards of 20 consultants in a single department, and a handful in other departments, unrelated to activity, is simply unsustainable. Over the past few years, the government has continued hiring staff without any analysis of need or any understanding of workload. It is no surprise that they end up being unable to pay.\nDe-centralise salaries - Every tertiary hospital in Nigeria currently arranges its own procurement of everything from paracetamol to equipment. There is absolutely no point anymore for a uniform salary structure from Port Harcourt to Potiskum, from Abeokuta to Damaturu, when the circumstances, cost of living, work load and almost every criteria to determine pay is radically different across Nigeria. Trying to sustain a uniform pay band across Nigeria might provide for equality but definitely not equity.\nMake every tertiary hospital in Nigeria publish its accounts - In tertiary hospitals, the \u201cChief Medical Directors\u201d are Chief Executives with un-paralleled powers. Every decision begins and ends with them. Other than the annual publication of budgets, no one knows how much money they get from the Federal Government, from the National Health Insurance Scheme, from fee-paying patients or how much they are spending. Let Nigerians know how much of their money is going to salaries, medicines, equipment, etc.\nImplement that National Health Act \u2013 The new National Health Act provides for the establishment of a National Tertiary Health Institutions Standard Committee that would regulate tertiary health facilities, providing guidelines for the use of Tertiary Hospital Management Boards. If this is implemented, and hospitals held publicly accountable to its implementation, this will make the consequences of strikes much more immediate for each hospital.\nWe have always held the opinion at Nigeria Health Watch that strikes should be an extreme last option for healthcare workers.  A strike means walking out on our patients, leaving them in the ICUs and emergency rooms. We recognise the challenges that many Nigerian healthcare workers face, trying to deliver care in a context where many of the basic functions of society are broken or non-existent; and the responsibility of the employer to the employed. But we also believe that a person choosing healthcare as a profession must examine their motivation and understand the choices that they make.\nIt is time for this conversation to happen, or else our descent will continue, and it may just reach the point\u2026 of no-return."}, {"author": "Chikwe Ihekweazu", "headline": "On World Tuberculosis Day - Reflections on a Forgotten Epidemic", "body": "March 24 was World TB Day, yet for most people that have the privilege of reading this piece, tuberculosis is an abstract term.\nWhy would a disease that infects about half a million Nigerians every year, and kills about 170,000 annually attract so little attention from the government, the health professions and from the people? The answer is simple \u2013 it is a disease that disproportionately affects the poor and marginalised. It is widely recognised that the poorer the community, the greater the likelihood of being infected with the TB germ and developing clinical disease. A lack of basic health services, poor nutrition, inadequate living conditions and HIV all contribute to the spread of TB. With poor access to health services to diagnose or treat patients, there is a longer delay between disease and treatment, perpetuating the spread of TB. In a hyper-capitalist society like Nigeria, it is not hard to see why patients with tuberculosis fall through the cracks.\nThe first challenge in Nigeria, as with many other things, is to understand the size of the problem. Over the past four years, about 100,000 cases of all forms of TB were diagnosed in health centres across the country. However, in 2012/13, the National Tuberculosis and Leprosy Control Programme (NTLCP), under the leadership of Dr. Olusegun Obasanya at the time, conducted the first ever population based national prevalence survey, which revealed some shocking results.\nThe estimated overall prevalence was double what was being counted and the incidence (rate of new cases) a year was three times previous estimates. Assuming a resident population of 170 million in Nigeria, the estimated number of new cases of all forms of TB would be about 570,000, revealing a huge gap in case detection. This showed that Nigeria\u2019s case detection rate for all forms of TB currently stood at only 15 percent, one of the lowest case detection rates in the world.\nFor the cases that are detected, they are almost exclusively managed in the public sector, and the management of TB has been generally limited to \"Directly Observed Treatment Short course\" (or \u201cDOTS\u201d) centres and \u201cChest Clinics\u201d, a practice that belongs in the dark ages. Contemporary science suggests that there is no medical or public health reason why patients with TB should be diagnosed and managed in any out-patient setting separate from any other patient. Mycobacterium tuberculosis is such a poorly virulent organism that the risk of transmission in an outpatient clinic in our context is minimal. This practice has led to a whole generation of doctors who have little experience in how to manage patients with TB, because all they do is refer to \"DOTS\" centres. It is time to change this and normalise TB treatment, by bringing it back into primary health centres in Nigeria. The national TB strategic plan (2015 \u2013 2020) suggests an expansion of DOTS services to more facilities across the country in order to improve case notification rates. We suggest going a step further: make every public healthcare facility in Nigeria a \u201cDOTS Centre\u201d. Every functional public health care facility should have the capacity and resources to manage patients with TB.\nHowever, to get TB cases into care, they need to be diagnosed. This is being addressed to some extent by the roll of out of the Xpert MTB/RIF assay (carried out in \u201cGeneXpert machines\u201d) in Nigeria. The Xpert MTB/RIF assay is a new test that is changing tuberculosis (TB) diagnosis by enabling the rapid diagnosis of TB disease and drug resistance. The test simultaneously detects Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex (MTBC) and resistance to rifampin (RIF) in less than 2 hours. In comparison, standard cultures can take 2 to 6 weeks for MTBC to grow and conventional drug resistance tests can add 3 more weeks. Up to the end of 2015,there are just over 200 centres with GeneXpert machines in Nigeria. The policy has recently been changed to allow the use of Xpert MTB/RIF assay for the diagnoses of all potential TB cases without restrictions, where the test is available. The GeneXpert equipment is however very expensive, and these costs go way beyond the initial costs. This paper by Abdurrahman et al showed that the \u201chidden\u201d costs of installing these machines could be up to 3 times the cost of the machines themselves. In addition, because these rely heavily on constant electricity to work, their utility is limited to centres where this is available. Of the 200 centres in Nigeria, most are in the public sector, with 22 being in the private sector; predominantly faith-based not-for-profit hospitals. This March, the NTBLCP in collaboration with USAID conducted an assessment of the TB laboratory diagnostic capacity in Nigeria, including laboratory infrastructure, technology and human resources. The results from this will further guide the efforts to increase case detection in Nigeria.\nNigeria has the fourth highest annual number of TB cases in the world. We cannot get on top of this by passive detection of TB as is currently the case. Studies such as this one by Oshi et al shows that intensified case finding combined with capacity building, provision of work guidelines, and TB health education can improve TB notification.\nFor World TB Day 2016, WHO calls on governments, communities, civil society, and the private sector to \"Unite to End TB\". WHO and partners are promoting dialogue and collaboration that unites individuals and communities in new ways to end the tuberculosis (TB) epidemic. These efforts cut across disciplines and sectors, and can help accelerate progress towards the Sustainable Development Goals overall by contributing to other areas including poverty elimination, universal health coverage, maternal and child health, social protection and justice. The World Health Organizations\u2019s End TB Strategy envisions a world free of TB with zero deaths, disease and suffering. It sets targets and outlines actions for governments and partners to provide patient-centred care, pursue policies and systems that enable prevention and care, and drive research and innovations needed to end the epidemic and eliminate TB.\nEvery country is judged by how it treats its most vulnerable.

The community was scared; they did not know who to trust.\nThe Nigerian Centre for Disease Control is evolving and Prof. Abdulsalami Nasidi has promised that its new Reference Laboratory in Kaduwa, Abuja will be ready for commissioning soon. On a morning television broadcast on the Nigerian Television Authority on the 20th of January he praised the efforts of the seven diagnostic centres in the country and promised to redouble control efforts. Colleagues in the Nigerian Field Epidemiology Training Programme are supporting the response.  As an epidemiologist myself, there is little that will make me prouder than a vibrant, professional Centre for Disease Control in Nigeria.\nHowever, the reality of this Lassa Fever outbreak, and all outbreaks that I have worked on in my many years as an infectious diseases epidemiologist have taught me that while epidemiology and diagnostic capacity are important components of health security, the most important line of defense may not be improved technology or quicker response times by my colleagues \u2013 epidemiologists, virologists, clinicians or surveillance officers.\nThe single most important factor in the control of outbreaks is trust in the health care system by the citizens of a country. A great \u201cCentre for Disease Control\u201d, is worth very little in the context of a public health care system that is largely dysfunctional, which its citizens do not trust.\nA lack of trust would not have prevented a few cases of Ebola emerging, but it was at the centre of the exponential spread of the Ebola outbreak in Liberia, Guinea and Sierra Leone, and at the heart of the challenges we faced during the response that I participated in, on the ground in Liberia. The need to focus on building trust in communities, and with their health care system is the most important lesson that I learnt from the response to the Ebola outbreak. A lack of trust in the public health care system is the most important reason the current Lassa Fever outbreak continues to spread.\nThe most likely transmission mechanism for the current Lassa Fever outbreak is person-to-person transmission. While rats are the likely source of initial infection, it is extremely unlikely, given the geographical distribution of cases that there is any on-going zoonotic source of infection. Therefore, to break the chains of transmission of the Lassa Fever virus, people must trust the health authorities enough to inform them of any signs of illness and not seek alternative sources of relief. Those infected and affected must trust that the healthcare workers\u2019 that they report to will treat them and care for them humanely in the presence of overwhelming historical evidence to the contrary.\nWhen a potential Lassa Fever patient declines to go into a primary health centre or hospital for care, this is often described as \u201cirrational\u201d and \u201cillogical\u201d behavior. Yet in the past the same healthcare workers have often failed to care for his child who had severe malaria, or failed to prevent the death of a sister following child birth? How could he be expected to suddenly trust the same health care worker that was never in his/her clinic all these years when he needed them?\nWhen this outbreak is over, the most likely scenario in Nigeria will be the re-start of the celebratory mode of the post Ebola period, rather than a period of introspection and retrospection. We will make speeches and pat ourselves on the back. However, this \u2018outbreak narrative\u2019 fails to capture the complexity of the underlying factor, trust, which I believe is largely responsible for the rapid spread and failure of initial control attempts of this outbreak. If we continue business as usual, we must expect the next outbreak pretty soon.\nThe most important line of defense for us in Nigeria is to rebuild our confidence in the capacity of our government to prioritize the health to its citizens.  This will require a complete turnaround in our health systems\u2019 capacity to respond to the \u201croutine\u201d health needs of a population. It is only by responding to these in \u201cpeacetime\u201d and building trust, will we have the capacity to respond better to the next crisis. Trust in our health systems will not prevent outbreaks (outbreaks of infectious diseases will always be with us), but it would most likely have prevented large outbreaks like the Lassa Fever one that we are experiencing. To do this, we need the Nigerian government to earn the confidence of its citizens in their ability to serve their interests and protect them.\nAs an infectious disease epidemiologist, my career has been built around measuring infectious disease burdens, determining trends, assessing risk factors and measuring the impact of control measures; this is my comfort zone. But I have learned that not everything that can be measured matters \u2013 and not everything that matters can be measured.\nTrust exemplifies this. When a society loses confidence in those to whom they would normally turn to in times of need, they resort to actions that can be generally considered \u201cirrational\u201d and illogical\u201d and unwittingly spread the disease further. Recognising this limitation has changed the way I view the relevance of my profession in the context of outbreak control. Learning from and applying this knowledge will be the most critical challenge of the post Lassa Fever outbreak period.\nNigerians, want their existing primary health centres to work. Only when trust is restored in the capabilities and compassion of the public health system can we hope to prevent large outbreaks from occurring. Restoring trust in existing primary health centres is much more important today than building 10,000 new ones."}, {"author": "Chikwe Ihekweazu", "headline": "Before the SDGs, how did Nigeria really do with the MDGS?", "body": "  By Chikwe Ihekweazu\nNigeria Health Watch\n\nIn August 2015, reports emerged in the Nigerian press that \u201cNigeria had attained the Millennium Development Goals\u201d.  The article above the Secretary of Programmes in the Office of the Senior Special Assistant to the President on MDGs, Mr. Ogenyi Ochapa, verbatim, with no critical commentary on the validity of his statement, which boldly declared: Nigeria has Attained HIV, Maternal Mortality MDGs ahead of Deadline!\nLate in September 2015, almost everyone in the Nigerian health establishment was in New York for the UN General Assembly (UNGA). It was at a side event of the UNGA, at the United Nations headquarters, that the country\u2019s final status report on the implementation of the Millennium Development Goals was released. We have tried to find out if there was a subsequent event in Nigeria to share this report with the Nigerian people, to no avail.\nOther than a few reports on the meeting in September, there has been almost no reportage on the report, or its outcomes. The entire development community has moved on to the new Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).One reason for this may be that the report itself is almost impossible to find. This most important report that describes the outcomes of a project that Nigeria and all supporting development partners invested billions of Naira is not on the website of the \u201cOffice of the Special Assistant to the President on MDGs\u201d as at the last time we accessed it, which was today, 10/11/15.\nBut it is important that we know if the \u201cGoals\u201d were achieved and what the outcomes of our investments were. So, we got hold of the MDGs End-Point Report and encourage you to read it.\nFirst, let\u2019s remind ourselves on what the Millennium Development Goals were meant to be. In 2000, at the United Nations Millennium Summit, 189 world leaders, including Nigeria\u2019s, adopted the Millennium Declaration to overcome poverty through a set of eight mutually reinforcing interrelated time-bound goals (MDGs) with related targets. One of the stated objectives of the \u201cGoals\u201d was to provide an \u201caccountability framework\u201d. The attractiveness of having goals is that simple statements can be made and communicated on if they were achieved or not. The MDGs were at the forefront of the global development agenda to eradicate poverty by 2015.\nIn Nigeria, as we do, in 2005 we created the Office of the Senior Special Assistant to the President on the Millennium Development Goals with Directors, Officers and a huge budget to provide guidance, coordination and oversight on the attainment of the MDGs.\nThere are eight goals, but for the purposes of our platform, lets examine how Nigeria did, from the report of the Office of the Senior Special Assistant, on the 3 health-related goals and associated targets; Goals 4, 5 and 6.\nGoal 4: Reduce Child Mortality \u2013 Target: Reduce by two-thirds, between 1990 and 2015, the under-five mortality rate. None of the indicators for this target; under-five mortality rate, infant mortality rate and the proportion of one year-old children immunized against measles were met in Nigeria.\nGoal 5: Improve Maternal Health \u2013 Target: Reduce by three-quarters, between 1990 and 2015, the maternal mortality ratio. The first indicator is on maternal mortality ratio, which the report says that Nigeria has met \u2013 from a baseline figure of 1000 deaths per 100,000 live births in 1990 to its end-point status of 243 per 100,000 live births in 2014.\nHowever this is contradicted by data from the Demographic and Health Survey done in Nigeria in 2013 and carried out by the National Population Commission and partners, which reported that the maternal mortality ratio in 2013 was 576 deaths per 100,000 births, an insignificant difference from the 2008 finding of 545 deaths per 100,000 births.\nDraw your own conclusions. None of the other indicators; proportion of births attended by skilled health personnel, unmet need for family planning, and antenatal care coverage were met.\nGoal 6: Combat HIV and AIDS, malaria and other diseases \u2013 Target: Have halted, by 2015, and begun to reverse the spread of HIV and AIDS. None of the nine indicators relating to HIV, TB and Malaria were met and on TB specifically, incident rates are actually increasing.\nIn summary, of the 16 indicators relating to three Millennium Development Goals relating to health, 15 were not met and only one was met. The one that was met, relating to maternal mortality is contradicted by data from a report considered to be the industry standard for that indicator, also commissioned by the same government.\nGranted, the MDGs were ambitious, and granted there has been some progress on many of the indicators, but there is really nothing to celebrate considering the funds invested by the Nigerian Government and development partners on behalf of the Nigerian people.\nBefore going full steam into committing funds to the new Sustainable Development Goals, it would be prudent to do a critical review on the approach taken by Nigeria. This is especially important as the government reaches conclusions on whether setting up a mini-parastatal as in the \u201cOffice of the Senior Special Assistant to the President on the Millennium Development Goals\u201d that was constructing buildings and boreholes across the country was the right approach rather than investing in the public institutions with a mandate to carry out these functions.\nWith a new government in place in Nigeria, just at the time the new SDGs have been agreed, there is no better time to ask these questions."}, {"author": "Chikwe Ihekweazu", "headline": "One year later, 5 most important lessons from the Nigerian Ebola Response ", "body": "By Chikwe Ihekweazu\nNigeria Health Watch\nOn October 20 2014, almost exactly one year ago, the World Health Organisation declared Nigeria Ebola free, 42 days after the last known case had occurred. At the time the world was in the grip of one of the largest and most terrifying public health disasters in generations.\nWhile not completely over, there are signs that we are finally getting to the end of this outbreak which has had an unprecedented impact on the sub-continent. The Ebola outbreak claimed thousands of people, including hundreds of doctors and health care workers and it will be a tragedy of immense proportions if lessons are not learnt and history repeats itself. While we wait for our governments and schools of public health to engage with this process, we offer a starting point of the reflection that should be happening across the country and continent.\nCompared to the three most affected countries, Nigeria had a relatively small outbreak. As the outbreak escalated in Liberia, Guinea and Sierra Leone, there was significant anxiety on the consequences of the introduction of the virus to Lagos, with its estimated population of 15 million, living in densely populated neighbourhoods. In many ways Nigeria was lucky that its first case entered the country through the main airport and presented to one of the most recognised private hospitals in Lagos. Here, the astute clinical acumen and professionalism of the staff of First Consultants Hospital Group led to the rapid diagnosis of Ebola and the sheer determination of its excellent group of clinicians prevented the patient from leaving the hospital at his request, most probably saving the country from many more infections. This was done at great personal sacrifice, with many of the team paying the ultimate price with their lives.\nSubsequently, the country experienced probably its finest hours in public health by rapidly mobilising the resources to mount a determined response. The rest is history, as the country managed to limit the number of cases to 19 with 10 deaths, confounding the predictions of doom that had spread around the world. Nigeria saved itself not only from a major public health crisis but also an economic one, as the consequences of exclusion from the global economy would have been a disastrous outcome for the country.\nOne year after the outbreak, it is important for the country to reflect both on what was achieved and how it was achieved, but most importantly we must ponder whether  the lessons learnt have formed the basis for the prevention of future outbreaks and the preparation of a more robust response in the future. We hope that the Federal Ministry of Health and its National Centre for Disease Control has carried out a similar exercise, or if not, that this piece inspires them to do so. We propose these five areas below as those that enabled the successful response in Nigeria and therefore should be further developed.\nCentral coordination through an \u201cEmergency Operations Centre\u201d (EOC)\nNigeria\u2019s rapid response to the introduction of Ebola benefited from having an established EOC that was funded and set up by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation to support the response towards the elimination of polio in Nigeria. The deputy incident manager of the polio EOC was rapidly deployed to lead theEbola EOC (watch a great interview with Dr Faisal Shuaib by Ebola Deeply). Nigerian authorities moved quickly to establish a co-ordinated response using EOC structures previously developed for its polio response and drew from its experience in setting up strict command and control structures to manage the response.\nAmong its activities, the team coordinated the follow up of thousands of contacts, developed a staffing plan that executed a social mobilization strategy that reached more than 26,000 households of people living around the contacts of Ebola patients, and ensured that resources required for the clinical management of cases were available. A number of partners from WHO, CDC, UNICEF and MSF were part of the EOC structure, however all reporting and communication was done through the incident manager appointed by the Ministry of Health for this purpose.  After the Ebola response using EOCs in Lagos and Port Harcourt, its core structure was moved to Abuja to maintain contingency arrangements. This has since faded away quietly. It is not clear what proactive steps the country is taking to sustain an operational EOC, nor where this would be located.\nThe public health function of the private hospitals\nIt is difficult to overstate the critical role that a culture of strong clinical governance and an awareness of public health responsibility played in shaping the response of the First Consultants Hospital Group in Lagos to the Ebola outbreak, led by Dr Adadevoh and her team . Population health as proposed by Kindig et al is a concept of health that focuses on \u201cthe health outcomes of a group of individuals, including the distribution of such outcomes within the group,\u201d and includes health outcomes, patterns of health determinants, and policies and interventions that link these two. Population health is primarily a goal\u2014a goal of achieving measurable improvements in the health of a defined population. Therefore it is important not only for those responsible for the health of populations, but for all those working in hospitals and clinics with a responsibility to deliver care to understand concepts such as prevalence, incidence, risk, and disease determinants at a population level in order to practise to a high level. If Dr Adadevoh and her team were not acutely knowledgeable on this, Nigeria would have ended up with a completely different outbreak. Dr. Ada Ighonoh, a young doctor at the hospital who survived Ebola, gave a personal account of how she survived and how she is using her second chance at life to prepare herself to prevent similar incidents from happening in the future. Every doctor should listen, and learn.\nCommunication matters more than ever during outbreaks\nDuring the outbreak, the media was saturated with messages on Ebola. It was on every media, on television, radio, on newspapers on social media. Suddenly there were Ebola experts everywhere and people were rapidly educated on the risks of the disease, the symptoms and what to do if one had symptoms. But this was not the case in the beginning of the outbreak, when stories on remedies such as \u201csalt water\u201d, \u201cbitter kola\u201d and \u201cNano Silver\u201d filled the airwaves as we clutched at straws, filled with anxiety. A completely volunteer group, EbolaAlert led by Dr Lawal Bakare rose out of Nigeria to be one of the most credible sources of information on Ebola. Led by young Nigerians, they quickly garnered over sixty thousand followers on twitter. At this time, there was virtually no usable information on the website of the Federal Ministry of Health and the Nigerian Centre for Disease Control did not and still does not have a website through which it can inform the population. The impact of poor communication was demonstrated acutely during the recent apparent Ebola\u201cscare\u201d in Calabar.\nInvesting in training and development: The National Field Epidemiology Training Programme example.\nA few years ago, with the support of the US CDC, the Field Epidemiology and Laboratory Training Program (FELTP) was set up in Nigeria.  This is a two-year competency-based training and service program in applied epidemiology and public health that builds the capacity to strengthen the surveillance and response systems of a country. It is managed by the Federal Ministry of Health, the Federal Ministry of Agriculture, in partnership with the University of Ibadan and Ahmadu Bello University in Zaria. The programme trains medical epidemiology residents, public health laboratory residents, and veterinary epidemiology residents for leadership positions. The field epidemiology component is similar to programs that have been established in more than 30 countries. Itis modeled after the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\u2019s (CDC) two-year Epidemic Intelligence Service (EIS) training program and is composed of 25% course work and 75% field work. Current and past fellows of the programme who were already trained in most of the requisite skills formed the bedrock of the contact tracing and case investigation teams during the Nigerian response. Having this cohort of experts readily available is a testament to the importance of investing in developing skills for the future.\n      5. Leadership\nThe leadership provided by the then Minister of Health, Professor Onyebuchi Chukwu, the then Governor of Lagos State, Babatunde Fashola, SAN, and his Commissioner for Health, Dr. Jide Idris were critical in controlling the outbreak. Despite some initial disagreements in approach, they maintained a collaborative framework in agreeing strategy and communication, recognising the lead responsibility of the Federal Government during major outbreak situations. They worked together to prevent the doomsday scenario of the rapid spread of the disease predicted in Nigeria. The function of leadership is not however limited to the public sector leaders but across the entire chain of command to the so-called \u201cboots on the ground\u201d that went house to house diligently following up on all the contacts.\nIronically, at the time of the outbreak, doctors working in public hospitals across Nigeria were on strike. This probably represents the biggest area of public sector leadership failure  in the health sector over the last decade.\nThere are definitely many other lessons that the outbreak has taught us, here we have offered our top five. Evaluations are only consequential if their results lead to change and improvement. There has been a lot of chest beating on the successful Nigerian response, now it is time to prepare for the future."}, {"author": "Chikwe Ihekweazu", "headline": "Three reasons Strikes will continue in Nigeria\u2019s Health Sector", "body": "No part of public service in Nigeria has experienced more strikes than the health sector.\nRight now, public tertiary hospitals in Nigeria are struggling to get back to life after another series of strikes. The University College Hospital, Ibadan, was crippled for 108 days by a strike called by the Association of Resident Doctors. At LAUTECH Oshogbo, a strike closed the hospital for 5 months, and in the Psychiatric Hospital in Yaba, doctors walked away from their duty posts leaving their patients to their own means.  The story of the Federal Medical Centre in Owerri is already legendary, as health workers came to \u201cwork\u201d every day but spent their time singing and praying on the hospital grounds, while ignoring their patients in the wards, protesting against the privatisation of some of the hospitals services. Their strike lasted for three months.\nThis story map details the major health sector strikes in 2015.\nLast year, many public sector hospitals across the country were closed for about half of the year following strikes as doctors refused to return to work, even during the Ebola outbreak. Almost as soon as they returned, other health sector workers under the aegis of the Joint Health Sector Unions (JOHESU) proceeded to strike from November 2014 to February 2015.\nWhen there are strikes in public sector hospitals, there are only two constituencies that suffer: a) the patients, and b) the tax-payer (i.e. you and I), who do not get a service that is paid for on our behalf by government. Other health workers not on strike all collect their full salaries and allowances, the health workers on strike are ultimately paid in most cases, and even the hospital still gets its normal allocation from the Federal Ministry of Health as well as its quarterly \u201callocation\u201d from the National Health Insurance Scheme, whether any of its\u2019 patients covered by the scheme received clinical care during that quarter or not. So, for health workers and hospitals there are few, if any, consequences from strikes.\nAs professional bodies in the health sector prepare for strike actions, they tend to make three assumptions which make the decision so easy in Nigeria. Below we examine these assumptions and highlight how they may not continue to hold in the future:\nGovernment will always settle, eventually: Let\u2019s tell ourselves the simple truth. Government has always settled. Not only have they always settled, they have not asked or received anything tangible in return.  Salaries have increased without any change to the quality of service delivered. The complexity of health and measuring impact makes accountability difficult. So, unlike in most other contexts, no doctor working in the public sector in Nigeria has a contract or specification that states what the clinical expectations are in terms of the service he/she is delivering.  There are no contracts with surgeons that state how many cases they are contracted to do, or how many patients physicians are expected to see. This also applies to other categories of health workers; and crucially also applies at institutional level. There are no process indicators, no quality indicators, no outcome indicators and definitely no patient satisfaction indicators. We do not know how many patients each public health facility is expected to see or what standard of service they are supposed to deliver. So there is absolutely no way for government (us) to know if we are getting value for money. We can pay salaries as high as we like, but until we link pay and funding to performance, nothing will change.  Although this has never happened, it is only a matter of time, until government starts asking for value for money from the sector.\nThe patients will always return: This is an assumption that we are glad to say is already being proven wrong. Patients will not always return, even those at the poorer end of the socioeconomic spectrum. A tour round many of the teaching and other public hospitals will reveal that many beds are empty, and increasingly so. There is a quiet evolution going on in the private health care sector in Nigeria. Previously, the sector was inherently inefficient with many two to four bed hospitals, whose ineffective management tended to charge over-the-top fees for the handful of patients unfortunate enough to end up in their care. This is changing, as a series of innovative groups are pulling together resources to build clinical collaborations that will enable high utilisation of services, lower costs and better care in the private sector.  Once this gains momentum, there will be less and less of a reason to go to many of the public sector hospitals. It will only be a matter of time for government to realise that they cannot continue funding these hospitals, when patients seek their care elsewhere.  Money will begin to follow the patient.\nStriking workers will always return to their jobs: This is the strongest of all the assumptions. However, staff of NITEL and NEPA also once thought that they would always have their jobs. If there are insufficient patients in most public sector hospitals and these hospitals are forced to close, the inevitable consequence is that there will simply be nothing to do in them. This is a natural consequence; it can be slowed, but cannot be stopped.\nThere are only two possible end points for the scenario playing out in the Nigerian public health care sector at the tertiary level; complete disintegration of the publicly delivered tertiary health care (similar to what happened with NITEL, NEPA) or a complete turn around. As it stands, the health  sector is surely and firmly walking towards self-destruction.  Too many health professions in Nigeria are so focused on their professional interests and egos that they seem to have lost sight of the bigger picture. In fighting for the ball, we are destroying it. If this continues, the outcome is inevitable. There will be nothing left to fight over.\nThe need has never been greater for real leadership to emerge from the professional bodies that will be willing to put the patient as the client front and centre of their action. There may only be a tiny window of opportunity to change course. Chances are that it is already too late\u2026 and that the downward spiral is well on its way.\nStill, we grasp for even a hint of light at the end of the tunnel, that our hopes may rise once again."}, {"author": "Chikwe Ihekweazu", "headline": "Can technology-based measurement transform the Nigerian Health Sector?", "body": "Can technology-based measurement transform the Nigerian Health Sector?\n0\nBy Chikwe Ihekweazu on Africa Diaspora Health Nigeria Technology\nThe Nigerian Banking Sector is almost unrecognizable compared to where it was just a few years ago. As a consumer, you can get cash from almost any ATM in Nigeria, transact business in any bank, pay for goods by mobile phone, and confirm transactions in seconds. You have access to statements 24/7, at least as long as there is connectivity. In addition to increasing the ease of transactions, the other major impact of these changes has been increased accountability and transparency, not just for the banks but for every individual or firm using bank services.\nIn contrast, our public sector hospitals these days seem to be constantly shut as one of several groups of health professionals is almost always on strike. While we may guess, we really do not know the impact this has on the Nigerian Health Sector. It is almost impossible to get data on how many surgeries surgeons actually carry out in our teaching hospitals or how many deliveries the midwives have performed in a month. What if we knew how many contact-hours medical students had with patients before being released to the world with that god-like title of \u201cDoctor\u201d? Would it make a difference to the perception we have of our apparently great healthcare institutions if we actually knew what they were \u201cproducing\u201d per naira of funds allocated? As budgets tighten for our governments, these questions will get even louder because healthcare is an expensive business. The biggest irony of all salary negotiations with health sector professionals in Nigeria is that they take place in the absence of any data on productivity.\nI have been reading about one of the greatest technology personalities of our time, more so since his interest in the health sector has grown; Bill Gates. One philosophy of his that has stuck with me is his reputed obsession for measurement. In his annual letter in 2013, Gates makes the case for how measurement has driven some of the biggest recent public health successes of this era. There is no doubt that improved data collection and sharing in Nigeria has been critical to the recent progress on polio in Nigeria.\nIncreasing accountability, efficiency and profitability in the health sector is not possible without the tools for measurement. Technology, especially mobile, has the power to transform the delivery of healthcare services and improve compliance, accountability and care. Driven by some of the fastest mobile subscriber growth in the world, cheaper mobile devices, and continued innovation, emerging mobile health solutions are already saving lives \u2013 an estimated 1 million of them by 2017, according to a recentreport by PricewaterhouseCoopers.\nDespite the growing interest in Mobile Health (mHealth) initiatives globally, adoption rates of mobile solutions has been slow in Nigeria. An emerging opportunity exists for healthcare providers to adopt mobile technology to not only to improve the effectiveness of healthcare delivery but to also measure and demonstrate results.\nWhile the sector is eager for mHealth solutions, most care providers in Nigeria still lack the required infrastructure to support widespread deployment of apps that might integrate personal medical information. Healthcare organisations will need to start from the basics, e.g. the deployment of Electronic Medical Records (EMR) systems, from which relevant data can be extracted and integrated into mobile health apps. When you consider that one of the major hospital groups in Nigeria, Lagoon hospitals only announced a full adoption of electronic medical records in 2013, it demonstrates how far the distance still is. Most medical records of patients in Nigeria are stored in folders as shown below.\nPaper Records at a Nigerian Hospital\nOne firm that is making progress in this space is Sabaoth Technologies Ltd, an all-purpose medical information systems firm, which is currently providing hospital information management systems to the Delta State University Teaching Hospital, Oghara and University College Hospital Ibadan in the public sector as well as several private hospitals.\nThere are other firms now making inroads into the health space. If you have not heard about the IT and logistics platform Integrahealth, note the name. Their flagship product \u2018DrugStock\u2019 enables the purchase of good quality drugs, managing the supply chain, payments, and capacity building for medium size hospitals mostly in Lagos, Nigeria. The co-founder Chibuzor Opara was at the World Economic Forumthis year speaking about their dream of increasing efficiency of hospitals in Nigeria and beyond.\nEarly in 2015, the Private Sector Health Alliance hosted \u201cThe Health Innovation Challenge;\u201d a multi-stage competition to recognise, reward and celebrate innovations that show potential to improve health in Nigeria. Several innovative firms and ideas competed for the challenge and some of these ideas will grow to dominate the sector in their niches in a few years.\nThere are also several examples from outside our shores. In Zambia, the government partnered with IBM to deploy a mobile program aimed at better managing the inventory and delivery of 200 life-saving prescription drugs. Staff members from three local health facilities are now using mobile devices with barcode scanners to record stock and generate real-time views of supplies. The solution also allows workers to transfer supplies and identify trends, thereby preventing gaps in the medical supply chain and ensuring that citizens have access to the medications they need.\nWhether it is in the public or private sectors, demands for data and information for multiple purposes, including performance improvement, accountability, and stakeholder decision making, are likely to increase in the future.  At the same time, there is a growing tech community with technology startups, developers and a fast-moving technology ecosystem which has been dubbed Silicon Lagoon.\nThe reason we are not measuring enough in the public sector is not because we lack the tools or the technology. It is also not for a lack of need or demand, but mostly it is because it\u2019s convenient for many not to measure, so that we do not know. Ignorance, for them, is bliss\u2026\nIf we want to transform our health sector, we must begin to measure performance. We may be shocked by what we find.\n  P/s: If you know of  projects, initiatives, ideas using technology innovatively in our health sector please share with us on twitter @nighealthwatch"}, {"author": "Chikwe Ihekweazu", "headline": "Liberia is declared Ebola free: can Nigeria support its Neighbours more?", "body": "Thankfully, Liberia is on its way back. The Ebola outbreak has been declared over, and life is returning to \u201cnormal\u201d. The streets are full of activity, and schools have reopened. Across the country, there is an unmistakable sense that people are desperate to get on with their lives.\nArriving Monrovia in January 2015, it felt familiar; like a mid-sized Nigerian town \u2013 perhaps Abakiliki or Ilorin. The food was familiar \u2013 fish, plantain, rice \u2026 with lots of red pepper. The electricity situation was still very poor, and most people in Monrovia relied on generators. As we drove past a white compound, the driver explained that it belonged to Charles Taylor. I shuddered as I thought of all the lives lost in a senseless civil war. About half a kilometer down the road, we passed another big white building on the left of Tubman Boulevard. It had \u201cNigeria House\u201d boldly inscribed on it. It\u2019s the Nigerian High Commission. The driver went on to explain with a sense of gratitude and respect the role that Nigeria had played in Liberia\u2019s history. I could not remember any other country that I had been to where I consistently had received such a warm welcome as in Liberia. I was proud.\nThe UN still had a military mission in Liberia. In the UN compound, there was a mix of military and police uniformed guys all around. I immediately noticed the uniform of the Nigerian police in the mix. The good work done by Nigeria around the sub-continent is often not recognised enough by Nigerians at home. Monrovia, Liberia\u2019s capital is home to about a third of the 4 million Liberians.  As is almost always the case, I ran into a number of Nigerian colleagues working in the various organisations responding to the outbreak, and we soon formed a tight bond. I slowly found my way around Monrovia.\nFrom the outside, with all the horror stories of Ebola in the popular press, it is easy to imagine Liberia as a country on the brink, especially with its history of protracted conflicts and civil war. But there is nothing further from the truth. Yes, it had been ill prepared for an outbreak of this severity and magnitude, as many other countries would have been, but sometimes there is nothing as powerful as grief to unite people in seeking a better future. The most important line of defence for Liberia is to rebuild the confidence of its population in the capacity of its government to prioritize the health of its citizens. This will require a complete turnaround in its health system\u2019s capacity to respond to the \u201croutine\u201d health needs of a population. It\u2019s only by responding to these issues in \u201cpeacetime\u201d and building trust, that it will have the capacity to respond better to the next crisis. When a society loses confidence in those to whom they would normally turn to in times of need, they resort to actions that can generally be considered \u201cirrational\u201d and \u201cillogical\u201d and unwittingly spread the disease further.\nIn order to rebuild their health system, Liberia will need the support of other West African countries, especially Nigeria.  At the beginning of the outbreak, Liberia was widely reported to have about 50 doctors working in the country;  one of the lowest physician-to-population ratios in the world. In Nigeria, there are over 30 medical colleges producing about 3,000 doctors annually. Perhaps, it is time to form strong regional alliances between the various postgraduate colleges in a win-win situation  including training and service for all the countries in the region. The same concept could apply to nursing professionals, pharmacists and medical laboratory scientists. However, this will only work if we are able to go about this with humility and a sense of service, not one of pride and arrogance.  \nFor Nigeria, it is time to think of our engagement with the sub-continent beyond the military and the police. Not many people may know about the \u201cTechnical Aid Corps (TAC)\u201d scheme that was established by the military regime of General Ibrahim Babangida in 1987 (like many other important institutions in Nigeria, it has no website for the public to follow its work). The sole purpose of the scheme is assisting States in Africa, Caribbean and specific regions in their social-economic development effort. Nigerian experts in various fields of human endeavour participate. Its most recent deployments are reported to be Uganda and Rwanda. Rwanda? I can guess what you are thinking! Until we begin to hold these Nigerian institutions to account on how they represent the strategic interests of our country, we cannot expect much to change.\nOut of this crisis must emerge a new Liberia. While the stories of dictators, civil war and Ebola are true, they cannot be Liberia\u2019s \u201csingle story\u201d. With a beautiful beach front right at the heart of the city, there is no reason for Monrovia not to be the favorite destination of Nigeria\u2019s emerging middle class. As Liberia grows, it will also begin to engage with the various opportunities in Nigeria. The earlier we really begin to see West-Africa for the common market that it should be, the greater the opportunities will be for the continent.\nFor now, it\u2019s just great that Liberia can get on with the difficult task of nation building."}, {"author": "Chikwe Ihekweazu", "headline": "Something to be proud of: Nigeria\u2019s Role in the AU Response to the Ebola Outbreak", "body": "There is increasing optimism that we will get to the end of the Ebola epidemic that has so badly affected Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea over the past year. In the first week of April, the lowest number of cases (30) were reported since May 2014. While there may still be some challenges ahead, the scale of the response and the translation of several learning points from the early part of the response have led to the quiet optimism that the end is in sight. This optimism is shared by responding organisations as well as health care workers in the most affected countries. Most of the current conversations have begun to focus on the restoration of health services with a strict infection control and prevention component. One organisation that has played a major role in this response but not gotten as much credit as it deserves is the \u201cAfrican Union\u201d (AU).\nWhile I was in Liberia earlier this year supporting the Ebola respose, I worked with epidemiologists, doctors, nurses, pharmacists and public health officers that are part of the African Union Support to Ebola Outbreak in West Africa (ASEOWA). ASEOWA is the African Union\u2019s contribution to on-going efforts to stop the transmission of the Ebola Virus Disease (EVD) in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone. Under Operation ASEOWA, health professionals were mobilized from around the African continent and deployed to the affected countries to assist with outbreak control efforts. This is the first time ever that the AU is initiating and implementing a mission of this size in response to a health crisis on the continent. The mission has  contributed significantly both in supporting the public health as well as clinical response to the outbreak. It contributed epidemiologists, who became part of the outbreak response activities, and clinicians supporting the restoration of critical health services.\nThe ASEOWA team of close to a thousand colleagues was made up of large contingents from Nigeria, Kenya and Ethiopia. Being Africans themselves, most of the ASEOWA team quickly integrated into various aspects of the response and rapidly gained the confidence of local colleagues. Whenever necessary, they joined teams in the field, going to some of the \u201chardest-to-reach\u201d areas to support various outbreak control activities. As the cases began to decline, members of the team were increasingly deployed into healthcare facilities to support activities that would lead to the restoration of services to the population. They acted not just as rare clinical resource in this situation but also provided emotional support and inspiration to other colleagues who felt exhausted and anxious after months of working under such difficult circumstances.\nThis being the first deployment of human resources in a health mission ever by the AU, there were some teething problems. Some colleagues had to wait longer than necessary before they were deployed to specific roles, and there were some uncertainties about where exactly their skills could be optimally utilised within the large response. The deployment of close to a thousand colleagues also required significant human resources management and logistics. There will definitely be many lessons to learn.  A comprehensive and independent evaluation of Operation ASEOWA is needed to learn vital lessons, both from the deployed individuals and the receiving countries\nThe large Nigerian delegation was ably led by Dr Joshua Obasanya, deployed from the Nigerian Centre for Disease Control. He was until recently the Director of Nigeria\u2019s Tuberculosis Control Program so came with years of experience of managing not only one of the oldest diseases known to man but one that had similar difficult elements that are key to the control such as \u201ccontact tracing\u201d. He was also part of the team that contained the outbreak of Ebola in Nigeria.\n\n\nDr Obasanya, leader of the Nigerian Delegation and Deputy Head of the ASEOWA team in Liberia\nThere have been recent pronouncements about the potential establishment of an \u201cAfrican Centre for Disease Control\u201d, maybe following the European model \u201cEuropean Centre for Disease Control\u201d. While this is a great idea on face value, it may be a bit premature. Right now, priority should be given to strengthen each country\u2019s capacity to carry out their statutory responsibility of responding to infectious disease threats in their own countries. In addition, the international health regulations actually provide an excellent framework for action from the international community when this is needed. While there is general agreement that this may not have worked optimally in this response, emphasis should be laid on strengthening capacity in individual countries rather than creating new organisations with uncertain mandates. The primary responsibility of preventing, managing and controlling infectious disease threats should remain firmly with each country.\nHowever, in exceptional circumstances like this, the AU should indeed be well placed to mobilize resources from countries like Nigeria, and it has done this fairly successfully during this response. Hopefully, there will be many lessons to be learnt, so that, while we are grateful for all the help from outside, the skills and experience gained by African colleagues on this mission will serve the continent well.\nWe look forward to welcoming those of our ASEOWA colleagues, who are still in the field, back home."}, {"author": "Chikwe Ihekweazu", "headline": "ON WORLD TB DAY, THERE IS LITTLE TO CELEBRATE IN NIGERIA", "body": "First published on Nigeria Health Watch.\nAs the Ebola epidemic in West Africa slows and falls away from the headlines, there is a temptation to view this outbreak as an isolated event and go back to life as usual. In Nigeria, the fairly successful response to the Ebola epidemic has brought a bit of credibility to the Nigerian health sector, with many Nigerian public health professionals smiling when confronted with the question \u201cHow did you guys do it?\u201d While there is definitely some satisfaction to be gained in the response to the Ebola outbreak in Nigeria, it does not change the fact that we are still in a precarious situation with several other infectious disease threats, which kill thousands of people in Nigeria. No other disease illustrates better our collective inability to deliver the essentials of a modern public health response to those who need help the most, in the most timely and efficient manner, than our response to tuberculosis (TB).\nWhile diseases like Ebola kill swiftly and produce horrific and acute symptoms, TB consumes many of its unknowing victims over a long period. It often goes undiagnosed for months, if not years, while it multiplies in families and communities. People infected with TB are often poor, marginalised and voiceless. Individuals who are ill with TB and not treated, can spread the bacteria through the air. Without correct treatment, more than 80 percent of people who fall ill will eventually waste away \u2014 coughing up blood while their bodies are ravaged by the disease \u2014 until they die. The difference is that they do not die in days, but in months \u2026 sometimes years.\nFor many years, there has been widespread suspicion that most of the cases of TB occurring in Nigeria are not detected by the system and are never able to access care. Under-diagnosis is probably the most significant reason for the low numbers of cases reported in Nigeria. TB diagnosis and care is only available in the public sector and in a few faith-based healthcare facilities. However, these sites are very unappealing for patients, as they are often poorly maintained inaccessible and located at the corners of hospitals.\nThe derelict \u201cChest Unit\u201d of the University of Nigeria Teaching Hospital (UNTH) hidden away at its old site\nThe first ever population based TB prevalence survey, (an attempt at measuring the burden of TB ) was conducted in Nigeria in 2012. Data from this survey provides some context to the low case notification data. The survey revealed a doubling of the estimated overall prevalence (the total number of people with TB) and a tripling of the estimated incidence (the total number of new cases) from previous WHO estimates. Based on the survey\u2019s findings, Nigeria\u2019s population of 170 million , in 2012, the estimated number of new cases of all forms of TB should have been about 550,000. However, Nigeria notified a total of only 97,000 new cases of all forms of TB in 2012, revealing a huge gap in case detection. Using these updated figures, Nigeria\u2019s case detection rate for all forms of TB currently stands at approximately 17 percent, one of the lowest case detection rates in the world. Based on the 2012 prevalence survey data, the country and WHO have updated their estimates for TB prevalence and incidence in Nigeria. This data is publicly available here.\nIn recent decades, we\u2019ve seen a surge in the number of people falling ill with strains of TB that are highly resistant to conventional treatment , which left untreated, kill rapidly. These strains are called multi drug resistant tuberculosis (MDR TB). Overall, the mean annual percentage increase in MDR-TB exceeded 100% in Nigeria, while MDR-TB case detection in 2012 was <10%. This means that most of the estimated 3,000 case of MDR TB in Nigeria are not diagnosed and do not enter the care pathway.\nAll over the world, tuberculosis is a difficult disease \u2013 difficult to diagnose and difficult to treat. But for the first time in years there is some real excitement on the TB scene with more rapid accurate diagnostic tools becoming available. Xpert MTB/RIF is a new test that simultaneously detects both the bacteria that causes TB and resistance to rifampicin, one of the main drugs used for its treatment directly from sputum in under two hours. WHO has recommended the use of the technology since December 2010 and is monitoring its global roll-out to promote coordination. A list of all the sites that have procured this new diagnostic option can be found here.\nMore than ever before, the Ebola outbreak presents the responsible public health departments and agencies in Nigeria with an opportunity to engage the attention of the Nigerian people to call for collective action to prevent future outbreaks and build capacity to respond to ongoing ones. We have a moral obligation to lend our voices to this broader struggle. We have learnt from the HIV/AIDS global epidemic that robust health systems are critical in mounting and sustaining a vigorous response to an emerging disease threat. This 2014 Ebola outbreak provides a unique opportunity to rebuild and strengthen health systems and should lead to much more robust investment in public health.\nTo find out how Nigeria has spent the US$ 147,354,856 that it received from the Global Fund in grants since the inception of the fund, go to their website here. To find out more about the Nigerian National TB Control Program, we would normally refer you to their website, but \u2026 it is \u201cdown\u201d. To find data on TB in Nigeria, sadly, you will have to go to the WHO website here.\nOn World TB Day, 24 March, WHO is calling for new commitments and new action in the global fight against tuberculosis. The call is most urgent in Nigeria. We are sitting and watching a ticking bomb. With the release of the first ever nationwide MDR TB and TB Prevalence surveys in Nigeria, one would have expected a massive scale up in the response, but very little seems to have changed \u2026"}][{"author": "Alec Ross", "headline": "The advice Shimon Peres gave me years ago that I'll always remember", "body": "Let me share a personal story about Nobel Peace Prize winner Shimon Peres, who passed away yesterday, and the enduring lessons of that story.\nA number of years ago, I was a young diplomat in Italy and scheduled to have a foreign policy debate with well-known former Ambassador to the United Nations, John Bolton. I knew that Bolton would not have heard of me, would not prepare, and would not particularly care about the sensibilities of the audience, which was made up of several hundred prominent executives, mostly Italian CEOs. When we met, he did not look at me, he just looked over my shoulder to see if someone more important or famous might be around. I\u2019m sure ambassador Bolton probably thought sharing the stage with some young guy was beneath him.\nI volunteered that the ambassador should go first, given his standing. He accepted and delivered a monologue that had little to do with the topic. Just the well-known one-liners and doctrine of ambassador John Bolton. His greatest hits, so to speak. None of it responded to the specific interests of the businessmen in the audience.\nI had prepared thoroughly, and after ambassador Bolton made his points, I responded with my opening remarks in Italian and included a joke that got everyone laughing, which Bolton of course could not understand since he did not speak Italian. I pulled two or three other little things like that, which were a product of preparation and caring about who was in the audience.\nBottom line, the young unknown diplomat destroyed the celebrity. Afterwards, Shimon Peres (who was sitting in the front row) came up to me and whispered in his distinct, gravelly voice, \"young man, you have demonstrated how to engage in asymmetrical warfare.\" We spoke later that night, and he told me that whenever a lesser experienced or lesser known person goes into competition with someone more experienced and better known, to make that person\u2019s standing a weaknesses. To match his lazy preparation with over-preparation. To match his seriousness and arrogance with a measure of levity and two measures of humility. Bolton was so humiliated that he did not come to dinner that night and left the conference a day early.\nFour weeks ago, I saw president Peres again. We were both back in Italy at the same place on Lake Como. We had our last conversation, discussing Russia, while drinking wine on a gorgeous Italian night. At the beginning of our conversation, I re-introduced myself to him. He smiled and said, \u201cI know who you are and I remember our conversation after the debate many years ago about asymmetrical combat. I know who you are because even though I am 93-years-old, I still prepare every day as though I am still a young man without the benefit of power and standing.\u201d President Peres explained to me that he read the biographies of everybody that would be at dinner and this reminded him of our earlier encounter. He was exhibiting the lessons that he ingrained when he was my age: preparation, understanding your surroundings and not relying on experience and celebrity.\nThat a 93-year-old Nobel Peace Prize winning president of a nation can do this until the end of his life inspires me to try to do the same.\nAlec Ross is the author of The Industries of the Future, from Simon & Schuster."}, {"author": "Alec Ross", "headline": "An open letter from technology sector leaders on Donald Trump\u2019s candidacy for President", "body": "We are inventors, entrepreneurs, engineers, investors, researchers, and business leaders working in the technology sector. We are proud that American innovation is the envy of the world, a source of widely-shared prosperity, and a hallmark of our global leadership.\nWe believe in an inclusive country that fosters opportunity, creativity and a level playing field. Donald Trump does not. He campaigns on anger, bigotry, fear of new ideas and new people, and a fundamental belief that America is weak and in decline. We have listened to Donald Trump over the past year and we have concluded: Trump would be a disaster for innovation. His vision stands against the open exchange of ideas, free movement of people, and productive engagement with the outside world that is critical to our economy\u200a\u2014\u200aand that provide the foundation for innovation and growth.\nLet\u2019s start with the human talent that drives innovation forward.

The coming decade will see societies transform as humans learn to live alongside robots.\nJapan is home to the longest-living citizens on earth and the biggest elderly population of any country\u2014and it\u2019s not getting any younger. Japan\u2019s current life expectancy is 80 years for men and 87 years for women and is expected to rise to 84 and 91, respectively, over the next 45 years. Between 2010 and 2025, the number of Japanese citizens 65 years or older is expected to increase by 7 million. Today, 25 percent of Japan\u2019s population is age 65 or older. By 2020, this is projected to increase to 29 percent and reach 39 percent by 2050.\nAll of those long-living elderly will need caretakers. Yet Japan\u2019s low birthrates mean that what once was a staple of Japanese family life\u2014taking care of one\u2019s grandparents and great-grandparents\u2014will no longer be a viable model at the scale the nation needs. There will not be enough grandchildren.\nWith Japan\u2019s persistently strict immigration policies curtailing the number of workers in the country, there will not be enough humans around to do the job at all. Japan\u2019s Ministry of Health, Labor, and Welfare predicts a need for 4 million eldercare nurses by 2025. Right now there are only 1.49 million in the country. Japan allows only 50,000 work visas annually, and unless something drastic changes, the math does not work.\nThis labor shortage will hit service-industry jobs like eldercare with ferocity and will be exacerbated because caretakers have a high job turnover rate due to low pay and high rates of work-related injury from lifting patients.\nEnter the robots.\nOur future caretakers are being developed in a Japanese factory right now. Just as Japanese companies reinvented cars in the 1970s and consumer electronics in the 1980s, they are now reinventing the family. The robots depicted in the movies and cartoons of the 1960s and 1970s will become the reality of the 2020s.\nRival Japanese companies Toyota and Honda are leveraging their expertise in mechanical engineering to invent the next generation of robots. Toyota built a nursing aide named Robina\u2014modeled after Rosie, the cartoon robot nanny and housekeeper in The Jetsons\u2014as part of their Partner Robot Family, a line of robots to take care of the world\u2019s growing geriatric population. Robina is a \u201cfemale\u201d robot, 60 kilograms in weight and 1.2 meters tall, that can communicate using words and gestures. She has wide-set eyes, a moptop hairdo, and even a flowing white metallic skirt.\nRobina\u2019s brother, Humanoid, serves as a multipurpose home assistant. He can do the dishes, take care of your parents when they\u2019re sick, and even provide impromptu entertainment: one model plays the trumpet, another the violin. Both versions are doppelgangers for the famous Star Wars C-3PO robot, although in gleaming white instead of gold.\nIn response, Honda has created ASIMO (the Advanced Step in Innovative Mobility robot), a fully functional humanoid that looks like a four-foot-tall astronaut stuck on Earth. ASIMO is sophisticated enough to interpret human emotions, movements, and conversation. Equipped with cameras that function as eyes, ASIMO can follow voice commands, shake hands, and answer questions with a nod or by voice. He even bows to greet others, demonstrating good Japanese manners. For an elderly patient, ASIMO can fulfill a range of tasks, from helping the patient get out of bed to holding a conversation.\nHonda is also focusing much of its research and commercialization on robotic limbs and assistance devices that are robotic but not free-standing robots. Its Walking Assist device wraps around the legs and back of people with weakened leg muscles, giving them extra power to move on their own. In the future, expect to see Honda making robotic hands and arms. Its goal is nothing less than helping paraplegics walk and the very frail rediscover the speed and power of their youth.\nNumerous other Japanese companies are pushing the big players like Toyota and Honda. Tokai Rubber Industries, in conjunction with the Japanese research institute RIKEN, has unveiled the Robot for Interactive Body Assistance (RIBA), which can pick up and set down humans up to 175 pounds and is designed for patient comfort: it resembles a giant smiling bear and is covered in a soft skin to guard against injury or pain.\nSimilarly, Japanese industrial automation company AIST has created PARO, a robot baby harp seal covered in soft white fur. PARO exhibits many of the same behaviors as a real pet. Designed for those who are too frail to care for a living animal or who live in environments that don\u2019t allow pets, such as nursing homes, it enjoys being held, gets angry when hit, and likes to nap.When President Barack Obama met PARO a few years ago on a tour of Japanese robotics innovations, he instinctually reached out and rubbed its head and back. It looks like a cute stuffed animal, but costs $6,000 and is classified by the US government as a class 2 medical device.\nJapan already leads the world in robotics, operating 310,000 of the 1.4 million industrial robots in existence across the world. It\u2019s turning to eldercare robots in part because it has to and in part because it, uniquely, is in a great position to leverage its advanced industrial technology toward the long assembly line of the human life span. But can robots really take care of humans?\n\u201cFor the idea of artificial companionship to be our new normal, we have to change ourselves, and in the process we are remaking human values and human connection.\u201d \u2014 Sherry Turkle, MIT professor\nJapan\u2019s private and public sectors certainly think so. In 2013, the Japanese government granted $24.6 million to companies focusing on eldercare robotics. Japan\u2019s prominent Ministry of Economy, Trade, and Industry chose 24 companies in May 2013 to receive subsidies covering one-half to two-thirds of the R&D costs for nursing care robots. Tasks for these robots include helping the elderly move between rooms; keeping tabs on those likely to wander; and providing entertainment through games, singing, and dancing.\nNevertheless, difficult challenges remain. On the technical side, it remains difficult to design robots capable of intimate activities like bathing patients or brushing their teeth. And most Japanese companies that are developing these robots specialize in industrial motors and electronic automation. They didn\u2019t enter the caretaking field with a keen grasp of how to forge an emotional connection, a crucial aspect of eldercare. Even as they improve, some observers\u2014 like Sherry Turkle, a professor of the social studies of science and technology at MIT\u2014question whether patients will ever be able to form a true emotional connection with robot caretakers. As Turkle warns, \u201cFor the idea of artificial companionship to be our new normal, we have to change ourselves, and in the process we are remaking human values and human connection.\u201d\nIf robot nurses catch on, she explains, they may even create a chasm between younger and older generations. \u201cIt\u2019s not just that older people are supposed to be talking,\u201d Turkle argues, referring to the goal of creating robots that can hold conversation, \u201cyounger people are supposed to be listening. We are showing very little interest in what our elders have to say. We are building the machines that will literally let their stories fall on deaf ears.\u201d\nThese technical questions (Can a robot brush a person\u2019s teeth?) and almost-spiritual doubts (Can, and should, emotional connections be made between humans and robots?) are both valid. Yet robot technology and applicability continue to advance in Japan, and answers to these questions will likely arise there in the near future. With too few caretakers, I expect robots to become a regular part of the Japanese family system.\nIf the aging nation can pull it off, robot caretakers will be a boon for its economy and will soon make the jump to the global economy, with potentially far-reaching consequences.\nMuch of the rest of the industrialized world is on the verge of a period of advanced aging that will mirror Japan\u2019s own. In Europe, all 28 member states of the European Union have populations that are growing older, and in the decades ahead, the percentage of Europe\u2019s population aged 65 and older will grow from 17 percent to 30 percent. China is already entering a period of advanced aging even as it continues to develop. Although its one-child policy is already being phased out, China is now demographically lopsided. Chinese women have on average 1.4 children, well below the replacement rate of 2.1, resulting in too few young people to provide for the elderly. The notable exception is the United States, where immigration policies partially mitigate the effects of an aging population.\nAs the populations of developed nations continue to age, they create a big market for those Japanese robots. And caretaking robots, alongside robotic limb technology, may simply be the first in a new wave of complex robots entering our everyday lives. Robots will be the rare technology that reaches the mainstream through elderly users first, spreading down as grandma shows off her next cutting-edge gadget for the kids and grandkids.\nTHE GEO-ROBOTIC LANDSCAPE\nThe robot landscape will be vastly differentiated by country. Just as wealthier and poorer citizens reside at different technological levels, so do wealthier and poorer countries.\nA few countries have already established themselves as leading robot societies. About 70 percent of total robot sales take place in Japan, China, the United States, South Korea, and Germany\u2014known as the \u201cbig five\u201d in robotics. Japan, the United States, and Germany dominate the landscape in high-value industrial and medical robots, and South Korea and China are major producers of less expensive consumer-oriented robots. While Japan records the highest number of robot sales, China represents the most rapidly growing market, with sales increasing by 25 percent every year since 2005.\nThere is quite a gap between the big five and the rest of the world. As both consumers and producers of robots, these countries outpace all others. By way of illustration, the number of industrial robots produced in South Korea, a country of 50 million people, is several times greater than the number produced in South America, Central America, Africa, and India combined, with populations totaling 2.8 billion. Russia is effectively a nonplayer in robotics despite its industrial base. It neither produces nor buys robots to any significant degree, instead maintaining extractive industries (natural gas, oil, iron, nickel) and industrial manufacturing plants that look and function the way they did in the 1970s and 1980s.\nRobots will be the rare technology that reaches the mainstream through elderly users first, spreading down as grandma shows off her next cutting-edge gadget for the kids and grandkids.\nThe big five\u2019s comparative advantage might even accelerate in the future, for these are the same countries that are most likely to incorporate the next generation of robotics into society, work, and home. They will own the name brands in consumer robots, and they\u2019ll power the software and networks that enable the robotics ecosystem. When I think about this symbiosis, I think about the Internet in the 1990s. It was not just the consumer-facing Internet companies that were born and based in Silicon Valley; it was also the network equipment makers like Cisco Systems and Juniper Networks. Today Cisco and Juniper have a combined 85,000 employees and $154 billion in market value. The same types of back-end systems will exist in the robotics industry. And the big five countries will benefit from being home to the high-paying jobs and wealth accumulation that go with being out ahead of the 191 other countries around the world. They will produce the Ciscos and Junipers of robotics.\nInterestingly, less developed countries might be able to leapfrog technologies as they enter the robot landscape. Countries in Africa and Central Asia have been able to go straight to cell phones without building landline telephones, and in the same way they might be able to jump ahead in robotics without having to establish an advanced industrial base.\nThe African Robotics Network (AFRON) offers a good model. A community of individuals and institutions, AFRON hosts events and projects to boost robotics-related education, research, and industry on the continent. Through initiatives like its 10 Dollar Robot Challenge, AFRON encourages the development of extremely low-cost robotics education. One winner was RoboArm, a project from Obafemi Awolowo University in Nigeria whose armlike structure is made out of plastic and runs on scavenged motors. The ability to generate low-cost innovation based on scarcity of materials is rooted in the concept of frugal innovation.\nAs robotics starts to spread, the degree to which countries can succeed in the robot era will depend in part on culture\u2014on how readily people accept robots into their lives. Western and Eastern cultures are highly differentiated in how they view robots. Not only does Japan have an economic need and the technological know-how for robots, but it also has a cultural predisposition. The ancient Shinto religion, practiced by 80 percent of Japanese, includes a belief in animism, which holds that both objects and human beings have spirits. As a result, Japanese culture tends to be more accepting of robot companions as actual companions than is Western culture, which views robots as soulless machines. In a culture where the inanimate can be considered to be just as alive as the animate, robots can be seen as members of society rather than as mere tools or as threats.\nIn contrast, fears of robotics are deeply seated in Western culture. The threat of humanity creating things we cannot control pervades Western literature, leaving a long history of cautionary tales. Prometheus was condemned to an eternity of punishment for giving fire to humans. When Icarus flew too high, the sun melted his ingenious waxed wings and he fell to his death. In Mary Shelley\u2019s Frankenstein, Dr. Frankenstein\u2019s grotesque creation wreaks havoc and ultimately leads to its creator\u2019s death\u2014and numerous B-movie remakes.\nThis fear does not pervade Eastern culture to the same extent. The cultural dynamic in Japan is representative of the culture through much of East Asia, enabling the Asian robotics industry to speed ahead, unencumbered by cultural baggage. Investment in robots reflects a cultural comfort with robots, and, in China, departments of automation are well represented and well respected in the academy. There are more than 100 automation departments in Chinese universities, compared with approximately 76 in the United States despite the larger total number of universities in the United States.\nIn South Korea, teaching robots are seen in a positive light; in Europe, they are viewed negatively. As with eldercare, in Europe robots are seen as machines, whereas in Asia they are viewed as potential companions. In the United States, the question is largely avoided because of an immigration system that facilitates the entry of new, low-cost labor that often ends up in fields that might otherwise turn to service robots. In the other parts of the world, attitudes often split the difference. A recent study in the Middle East showed that people would be open to a humanoid household-cleaning robot but not to robots that perform more intimate and influential roles such as teaching. The combination of cultural, demographic, and technological factors means that we will get our first glimpse of a world full of robots in East Asia.\nHUMANIZING ROBOTS\nThe first wave of labor substitution from automation and robotics came from jobs that were often dangerous, dirty, and dreary and involved little personal interaction, but increasingly, robots are encroaching on jobs in the service sector that require personalized skills. Jobs in the service sector that were largely immune from job loss during the last stage of globalization are now at risk because advances in robotics have accelerated in recent years, due to breakthroughs in the field itself as well as new advancements in information management, computing, and high-end engineering. Tasks once thought the exclusive domain of humans\u2014the types of jobs that require situational awareness, spatial reasoning and dexterity, contextual understanding, and human judgment\u2014are opening up to robots.\nTwo key developments have dovetailed to make this possible: improvements in modeling belief space and the uplink of robots to the cloud. Belief space refers to a mathematical framework that allows us to model a given environment statistically and develop probabilistic outcomes. It is basically the application of algorithms to make sense of new or messy contexts. For robots, modeling belief space opens the way for greater situational awareness. It has led to breakthroughs in areas like grasping, once a difficult robot task. Until recently belief space was far too complex to sufficiently compute, a task made all the more difficult by the limited sets of robot experience available to analyze. But advances in data analytics have combined with exponentially greater sets of experiential robot data to enable programmers to develop robots that can now intelligently interact with their environment.\nThe recent exponential growth of robot data is due largely to the development of cloud robotics, a term coined by Google researcher James Kuffner in 2010. Linked to the cloud, robots can access vast troves of data and shared experience to enhance the understanding of their own belief space. Before being hooked up to the cloud, robots had access to very limited data\u2014either their own experience or that of a narrow cluster of robots. They were stand-alone pieces of electronics with capabilities that were limited to the hardware and software inside the unit. But by becoming networked devices, constantly connected to the cloud, robots can now incorporate the experiences of every other robot of their kind, \u201clearning\u201d at an accelerating rate.\nImagine the kind of quantum leap that human culture would undertake if we were all suddenly given a direct link to the knowledge and experience of everyone else on the planet\u2014if, when we made a decision, we were drawing from not just our own limited experience and expertise but from that of billions of other people. Big data has enabled this quantum leap for the cognitive development of robots.\nWith a connection to the cloud, robots can now incorporate the experiences of every other robot of their kind, \u201clearning\u201d at an accelerating rate.\nAnother major development in robotics arrives through materials science, which has allowed robots to be constructed of new materials. Robots no longer have to be cased in the aluminum bodies of armor that characterized C-3PO or R2-D2. Today\u2019s robots can have bodies made of silicone, or even spider silk, that are eerily natural looking. Highly flexible components\u2014such as air muscles (which distribute power through tubes holding highly concentrated pressurized air), electroactive polymers (which change a robot\u2019s size and shape when stimulated by an electric field), and ferrofluids (basically magnetic fluids that facilitate more humanlike movement)\u2014have created robots that you might not even recognize as being artificial, almost like the Arnold Schwarzenegger cyborg in The Terminator. An imitation caterpillar robot designed by researchers at Tufts University to perform tasks as varied as finding land mines and diagnosing diseases is even biodegradable\u2014just like us.\nRobots are now also being built both bigger and smaller than ever before. Nanorobots, still in the early phases of development, promise a future in which autonomous machines at the scale of 10-9 meters (far, far smaller than a grain of sand) can diagnose and treat human diseases at the cellular level. On the other end of the spectrum, the world\u2019s largest walking robot is a German-made fire-breathing dragon that stands at 51 feet long, weighs 11 tons, and is filled with more than 20 gallons of stage blood. Apparently the Germans have a festival involving it.\nRecent advances will continue. It is not just Japan\u2019s government that is devoting ever-increasing resources to robotics. In the United States, President Obama launched the National Robotics Initiative in 2011 to stimulate development of robots for industrial automation, elder assistance, and military applications. Run by the National Science Foundation, the program has awarded more than $100 million in contracts. France has initiated a similar program, pledging $126.9 million to develop its industry and catch up to Germany. Sweden has similarly earmarked millions to give out to individuals and corporations through innovation awards such as Robotdalen (\u201crobot valley\u201d), launched in 2011.\nThe field of robotics is very much like where the world stood with the Internet 20 years ago. We are at the beginning of something: chapter one, page one.\nThe private sector is also investing at increasingly higher levels. Google purchased Boston Dynamics, a leading robotics design company with Pentagon contracts, for an untold sum in December 2013. It also bought DeepMind, a London-based artificial intelligence company founded by wunderkind Demis Hassabis. As a kid, Hassabis was the second-highest-ranked chess player in the world under the age of 14, and while he was getting his PhD in cognitive neuroscience, he was acknowledged by Science magazine for making one of the ten most important science breakthroughs of the year after developing a new biological theory for how imagination and memory work in the brain.\nAt DeepMind, Demis and his colleagues effectively created the computer equivalent of hand-eye coordination, something that had never been accomplished before in robotics. In a demo, Demis showed me how he had taught his computers how to play old Atari 2600 video games in the same way that humans play them, based on looking at a screen and adjusting actions through neural processes responding to an opponent\u2019s actions. He\u2019d taught computers how to think in much the way that humans do. Then Google bought DeepMind for half a billion dollars and is applying its expertise in machine learning and systems neuroscience to power the algorithms it is developing as it expands beyond Internet search and further into robotics.\nMost corporate research and development in robotics comes from within big companies (like Google, Toyota, and Honda), but venture capital funding in robotics is growing at a steep rate. It more than doubled in just three years, from $160 million in 2011 to $341 million in 2014. In its first year of investment, Grishin Robotics, a $25 million seed investment fund, evaluated more than 600 start-ups before coming to terms with the eight now in its portfolio. Singulariteam, a new Israeli venture capital fund, quickly raised two funds of $100 million each to invest in early-stage robotics and artificial intelligence. The appeal for investors is obvious: the market for consumer robots could hit $390 billion by 2017, and industrial robots should hit $40 billion in 2020.\nAs the technology continues to improve, there is an ongoing debate about just how radically human life will be transformed by advanced robots and whether robots will ultimately surpass us. One view in the debate is that it\u2019s inevitable robots will pass us; another is that they can\u2019t possibly compete with us; a third is that man and machine could merge. Within the robotics community, the future of technology is wrapped up in the concept of singularity, the theoretical point in time when artificial intelligence will match or surpass human intelligence. If singularity is achieved, it is unclear what the relationship between robots and humans will become. (In the Terminator series, once singularity is achieved, a self-aware computer system decides to launch a war on humans.)\nEnthusiasts for the singularity imagine that investments in robotics will do more than strengthen corporate balance sheets; they will radically enhance human well-being, eliminating mundane tasks and replacing diseased or aging parts of our bodies. The technology community is deeply divided about whether singularity is a good thing or a bad thing, with one camp believing it will enhance human experience as another camp, equally large, believes it will unleash a dystopian future where people become subservient to machines.\nBut will singularity occur?\nThose who believe that singularity will be achieved point to several key factors. First, they argue that Moore\u2019s law, which holds that the amount of computing power we can fit into a chip will double every two years, shows little sign of slowing down. Moore\u2019s law applies to the transistors and technology that control robots as well as those in computers. Add rapid advances in machine learning, data analytics, and cloud robotics, and it\u2019s clear that computing is going to keep rapidly improving. Those who argue for the singularity differ on when it will occur. Mathematician Vernor Vinge predicts that it will occur by 2023; futurist Ray Kurzweil says 2045. But the question looming over singularity is whether there\u2019s a limit on how far our technology can ultimately go.\nThose who argue against the possibility of singularity point to several factors. The software advances necessary to reach singularity demand a detailed scientific understanding of the human brain, but our lack of understanding about the basic neural structure of the brain impedes software development. Moreover, while weak artificial intelligence, whereby robots simply specialize in a specific function, is currently advancing exponentially, strong artificial intelligence, whereby robots demonstrate humanlike cognition and intelligence, is advancing only linearly. While inventions like IBM\u2019s Watson (the computer designed by IBM that beat Jeopardy! champions Ken Jennings and Brad Rutter) are exciting, scientists need a better understanding of the brain before these advances progress beyond winning a game show. Watson didn\u2019t actually \u201cthink\u201d; it was basically a very comprehensive search engine querying a large database. As robotics expert and UC Berkeley professor Ken Goldberg explains, \u201cRobots are going to become increasingly human. But the gap between humans and robots will remain\u2014it\u2019s so large that it will be with us for the foreseeable future.\u201d\nIt\u2019s my view that the current moment in the field of robotics is very much like where the world stood with the Internet 20 years ago. We are at the beginning of something: chapter one, page one. Just as it would have been difficult in the days of dial-up modems to imagine an Internet video service like YouTube streaming over 6 billion hours of video every month, it is difficult for us to imagine today that lifelike robots may walk the streets with us, work in the cubicle next to ours, or take our elderly parents for a walk and then help them with dinner.\nThis is not happening today and it will not happen tomorrow, but it will happen during most of our lifetimes. The level of investment in robotics, combined with advances in big data, network technologies, materials science, and artificial intelligence, are setting the foundation for the 2020s to produce breakthroughs in robotics that bring today\u2019s science fiction right into mainstream use.\nAlec Ross is the New York Times bestselling author of The Industries of the Future, recently released by Simon & Schuster.

They want Apple to hack its own product by building an entirely new version of its iOS software and they want it to deliberately have security holes and weakened encryption so that the FBI can access the data on iPhones. \nIf Apple does this, then the idea that only the FBI will be able to exploit this new vulnerability is na\u00efve. By mandating that companies undermine their own encryption, it opens vulnerabilities that weaken the integrity of security systems for everyone.\nIf a backdoor is built for the FBI, then I believe that the door is also open for the Chinese, the Russians, and for non-state based hackers to enter, too.\nWhat\u2019s more, if US policy requires mandatory assistance from companies to break encryption, it is certain that other countries will demand the same on the same precedent.  And unlike the United States, their motives will not necessarily be bound by the rule of law.  This puts American companies in an impossible position. \nThe FBI is not acting with malignant intent. This is no longer J. Edgar Hoover\u2019s FBI. However, by trying to solve a short-term problem (accessing the contents of a single terrorist\u2019s iPhone) they are creating a much bigger, long-term problem: opening access to once secure systems.\nAs more of our life is connected to the cloud, the idea that mandatory backdoors are built-in is a nightmare. In my book The Industries of the Future, I argue that as we store things like our medical records to the cloud, that we must make sure those systems are encrypted and secure. This means no mandatory backdoors. \nFor these reasons and others, intelligence agencies including the NSA and GCHQ have come out clearly in favor of strong encryption with no backdoors. Law enforcement has other methods to get access to data other than mandating decryption. \nFor all of our security, let\u2019s hope that Apple prevails on this issue and the FBI does not.\nAlec Ross is the author of The Industries of the Future, recently released by Simon & Schuster."}, {"author": "Alec Ross", "headline": "Silicon Valley dominated the world for 20 years. Who wins in the next 20 years, though, is still a very big question.", "body": "\u201cWe want to create our own Silicon Valley.\u201d\nIf there\u2019s a single sentence I\u2019ve heard in every country I\u2019ve been to, it\u2019s this one. Silicon Valley has been home to technology-driven innovation for a long time, but the 20-year period from 1994 to 2014 was something special.\nPeople all over the world witnessed a spectacular level of innovation and wealth creation, all emerging from a small 30-mile long, 15-mile-wide strip of Northern California. Other states and countries have been attempting to build the \u201cnext Silicon Valley\u201d for years now. At this point, there\u2019s even a formula.\nAs Marc Andreessen writes:\nThe popular recipe for creating the \u201cnext\u201d Silicon Valley goes something like this:\nBuild a big, beautiful, fully equipped technology park;\nMix in R&D labs and university centers;\nProvide incentives to attract scientists, firms and users;\nInterconnect the industry through consortia and specialized suppliers;\nProtect intellectual property and tech transfer;\nEstablish a favorable business environment and regulations.\nIt happens all the time all over the world. And it never works.\nWhen I\u2019m asked, \u201cWhat can we do to create our own Silicon Valley?\u201d my response surprises many people: \u201cYou can\u2019t,\u201d I say. \u201cIt\u2019s too late. Silicon Valley has a decades-long head start creating the perfect environment for creating Internet businesses. What you can do, though, is position your communities to compete and succeed in those areas of innovation that are still to come.\u201d\nThe development of fields such as genomics, robotics, and cyber will all benefit from the interventions that Andreessen listed. But for cities or countries seeking to create the next hotbed for any of these fields, there are also broader factors to consider.\nBuilding an innovation-rich place like Silicon Valley requires specific cultural and labor-market characteristics that can contradict both a society\u2019s norms and the more controlling impulses of government leaders. \nA critical factor: domain expertise\nWith the industries of the future \u2014 a topic I researched extensively as part of my new book \u2014 new avenues of opportunity for countries and people alike will hinge on domain expertise: deep knowledge about a single industry, which tends to concentrate in specific cities or regions. Detroit has domain expertise in cars, Paris has it in fashion, and Silicon Valley has it in Internet-based businesses.\nDomain expertise for the industries of the future is still broadly distributed. To understand domain expertise, consider the following question: Why do a ridiculously high percentage of Internet companies still come out of Silicon Valley when massive investment is being made around the world to compete with it? Many factors are at play, but domain expertise is the most important.\nFor more than 20 years, the world\u2019s best computer scientists have overwhelmingly been based in Silicon Valley. They could have been born anywhere, but they came to Silicon Valley for school (Stanford or Berkeley), employment (which creates a self-reinforcing cycle that concentrates talent), and investment (with the Valley offering far and away the most access to early-stage capital in the world). And they came to be included in a culture and community that placed the computer science engineer at the highest level of social status.\nThe Valley came to be not just any old industrial center, but a kind of beacon\u2014a place that promised not just opportunity but a sense of belonging\u2014and that continues to attract wave after wave of ambitious entrepreneurs. But nothing like that exists yet for the industries of the future, where the most interesting and important innovations are taking place with greater geographic spread than we see with Internet-based innovation.\nThere are early geographic leaders in each of the fields, but it is still far too early to describe any of these as the winners or losers in the competition to be home to the next generation of innovation. And what concentration there is today is not destined to be permanent.\nIn the current landscape, the most important work in the commercialization of genomics is clustered around universities where much of the original research and development took place. It is in and around Boston because of Harvard and MIT, Baltimore because of Johns Hopkins, and Silicon Valley because of Stanford and the Universities of California in San Francisco and Berkeley. Walking through the offices of these companies, one can\u2019t help but notice how diverse the workforces are. European, Asian, African, and South American employees fill these companies and live in Boston, Baltimore, or California because they all studied at American universities.\nThe other major prong of genetics research is in China. Though it does not have a top university program in genetics, China has done an excellent job recruiting its citizens back home after they have studied abroad. As a result, Beijing is quickly becoming a center of domain expertise in genomics. In cyber, the most interesting companies are often based proximate to government, where domain expertise was developed inside the best law enforcement and intelligence communities, including Washington, D.C., Tel Aviv, London, and Moscow. Europe\u2019s first cybersecurity accelerator, CyLon, was cofounded by two top foreign policy aides to British prime ministers. One of the world\u2019s largest cybersecurity companies, Kaspersky Lab, is full of former Russian military and intelligence officers.\nIsrael has many of the best cybersecurity firms, founded by people who got their start in cyber in the Israeli Defense Forces, especially Unit 8200, Yehida Shmoneh-Matayim, the intelligence corps focused on signals intelligence.\nIn robotics, domain expertise and the early commercial leadership is generally concentrated where there is preexisting domain expertise in electronics and advanced manufacturing\u2014in countries like Japan, South Korea, and Germany. Yet even as the industries of the future offer new opportunities to rising hotbeds of innovation around the world, it\u2019s interesting to watch how Silicon Valley\u2019s influence lingers and continues to draw start-ups in almost every industry. Consider the example of digital currency and fintech, industries of the future that blend old world and new.\nNew York and London are the world\u2019s two dominant centers of domain expertise in global banking today, and both are home to substantial fintech investment. Over the past five years, the United Kingdom and Ireland were home to 52 percent of all the fintech financing in Europe. And New York drew even larger levels of fintech financing than London, with dozens of deals putting hundreds of millions of dollars into the bank accounts of technology companies trying to make the banking sector smarter.\nBut when Zac Townsend wanted to start a company focused on smartening up the banking industry, he did not start it in London or New York. He started it in California. It mattered less to Zac that expertise in banking specifically was in New York or London than that the expertise in innovation and its supporting culture was in California. He believed that in order to change the banking system, he had to work with it but away from it\u2014an approach that is also reflected in the broader data.\nAlthough New York and London are the global centers for banking, they are respectively second and third in fintech financing behind Silicon Valley, which gets about one-third of all the investments that take place in the fintech space. This raises an interesting question about just how distributed the industries of the future are going to be.\nSilicon Valley: the next Roman empire?\nWhen twentysomethings like Zac decide to start a company and determine that in order to do so they need to be in California, it creates a self-perpetuating cycle. More broadly, Zac\u2019s decision to base his new data-driven finance company in Silicon Valley reflects a roiling debate over just how domain expertise will develop in the big data industry and what effect this is going to have on the global economy as a whole. With the major impact that big data is having on almost every industry, the way that big data expertise develops has the potential to change the very nature of business. And investors are placing big bets on two very different answers.\nWill big data serve to centralize businesses, pulling more industries into the gravitational field of Silicon Valley? Or will it allow more businesses to innovate wherever they are, in effect creating more opportunities in more places around the world than has been possible before now?\nOn one side of the argument is Charlie Songhurst, who sees the Valley as a burgeoning global empire. Because of Silicon Valley, Charlie says, \u201cGlobal regional inequality is going to be unlike anything we\u2019ve ever seen except maybe the comparative power of Rome versus the rest of the ancient world.\u201d While I think Charlie overstates things, he makes an argument that\u2019s worth examining.\nHis thesis lines up with a number of other thinkers who believe that Silicon Valley\u2019s expertise in software and analytics will swallow up entire industries and cause massive centralization. The founders of Uber had no particular expertise in transportation, but that did not matter because of their ability to build a software and analytics platform. The idea that underlies Songhurst\u2019s vision is that Silicon Valley companies could eventually run everything in which software and big data are useful\u2014which is basically every industry on the planet. So what\u2019s going to happen in this new data-driven empire, according to Charlie? \u201cIt\u2019s a very simple equation,\u201d he says. \u201cCountries with high education and low wages will export IQ. That will be the Baltics, India, China. Of course, it\u2019s terrible if you\u2019re in Ohio or England or France or someone competing with an Estonian. So what you\u2019ll get is a massive mean reversion of income throughout the world where the Valley, Israel, China, and maybe a couple of other places get very high economic returns and everywhere else in the world starts to revert to the mean. Again, it starts to look more like the Roman Empire.\u201d\nIt is also the case that while the powers that be in Silicon Valley might not be the earliest movers in fields like precision agriculture, once success is achieved elsewhere, they don\u2019t just sit back as passive bystanders and watch it grow. Google chairman Eric Schmidt recruited an Israeli entrepreneur, Dror Berman, to move to Silicon Valley and head up Innovation Endeavors, a large venture firm that invests Schmidt\u2019s money. Israel is home to many of the 20th century\u2019s great innovations in farming. Berman brought the intellectual curiosity about agriculture with him to Silicon Valley and developed Farm2050, a partnership that aspires to combine data science and robotics to improve farming with a group of partners as diverse as Google, DuPont, and 3D Robotics.\nDror recognized that Silicon Valley can be a little too navel-gazing, and told me that 90 percent of the region\u2019s entrepreneurs focus on 10 percent of the world\u2019s problems. With Farm2050, he is trying to bring Silicon Valley\u2019s A game to agriculture. Silicon Valley\u2019s history as a home to apricot and plum orchards is long past, and if it does establish itself as the source of winning investment or innovation for precision agriculture, it will contradict the idea that domain expertise will drive the industries of the future. Instead, it would suggest, as futurist Jaron Lanier has argued in his book Who Owns the Future?, that those who hold the most data, the fastest servers, and the most processing power will drive all growth from here on out.\nIt\u2019s basically the idea that Google could do my job and your job\u2014 and everyone else\u2019s job\u2014better if they wanted to simply by applying their top-of-the-line analytics abilities. There is an increasingly large audience, however, that holds a different view from Charlie Songhurst. They believe that big data, instead of absorbing and supplanting other industries, will serve as a broad tool that every existing industry can use to spur growth. The idea is that data will become widely usable and scalable enough that it won\u2019t have domain expertise in the same way that other high-barrier-to-entry industries of the future like genomics or robotics do.\nThis view was explained to me by Mark Gorenberg, a veteran of West Coast venture investing who saw the investment case for analytics early and built a venture capital firm around it, Zetta Venture Partners. Mark has been in venture capital for a quarter-century and splits most of his time among investing, work with MIT, and serving as an advisor to the president of the United States as a member of the President\u2019s Council of Advisors on Science and Technology. Gorenberg believes the big data economy will extend far beyond Silicon Valley.\nHe says: \u201cAnalytics businesses will come from anywhere. You have the algorithmic expertise on one side that is coming out of a lot of universities and you have the domain expertise for particular industries, which manifest themselves everywhere.\u201d Gorenberg argues that as the big data market grows over the next couple of decades, it can be a source of revitalization for old industrial centers where local domain expertise exists.\nIn the rust belt, for example, he sees strong opportunities for the development of analytics firms rooted in the region\u2019s strength managing industrial processes. He sees Boston\u2019s strength as a biotech center enabling it to create health data companies, and he foresees the creation of energy analytics companies in Texas. He predicts that we will see strong privacy and forensics companies forming around Washington, D.C., that build on the capabilities in the law enforcement and intelligence communities, providing high-paying jobs for people who worked at the NSA, CIA, and FBI.\nIf Gorenberg is correct that \u201cdomain expertise is everywhere,\u201d then there is no reason not to be optimistic about the prospects for big data firms developing outside the United States. It just takes a combination of algorithmic expertise and domain expertise.\nFor example, having lost out on the wealth creation built around the Internet, Germany is now determined to leverage its domain expertise in logistics and household appliances to own the analytics markets in those areas of traditional strength, an initiative it calls Industrie 4.0. If the big data market develops as Gorenberg predicts\u2014with the best companies being headquartered all over the world\u2014then wealth creation will look entirely different for big data than it did for the Internet, where the benefits were concentrated in a 30-by-15- mile area.\nI was persuaded by Gorenberg\u2019s view when I was in New Zealand and saw an example of how the combination of big data and domain expertise will determine the geography of the industries of the future. New Zealand is home to twice as many dairy cattle as human beings. The Kiwis know cows.\nWhile there, I learned about the impact of Pasture Meter, a precision-agriculture technology developed in Palmerston, a community of 82,000 people in the Manawatu-Wanganui region of New Zealand\u2019s North Island, more than 10,000 kilometers away from Silicon Valley. Pasture Meter uses advanced sensor technology to take 200 measurements per second over vast swaths of farmland to identify how much grass is in a paddock so that dairy cows can be distributed most effectively for feeding. It alerts farmers to the amount of feed they have and identifies low-production areas that need intervention from the farmer, say, more fertilizer.\nTraditional technology for evaluating fields, like ultrasound or rising plate meters, typically captures only 250 readings of a pasture, whereas Pasture Meter can take up to 18,500 readings. Anyone with a phone can use the technology, and it works regardless of factors like weather.\nIt may seem that monitoring pastures\u2014literally watching the grass grow\u2014is an unnecessary use of real-time analytics, but the Kiwi farmers know better. With the massive increase in upward economic mobility in China, there was increasing demand for beef and dairy products, but New Zealand\u2019s cattle farmers needed higher levels of efficiency\u2014greater scale and lower prices\u2014if they were going to sell into such a large market.\nChina\u2019s population is 288 times the size of New Zealand\u2019s. With strong domain expertise in dairy farming, local farmers and farm-equipment manufacturers knew that if they could feed their cattle more efficiently, that would increase output enough for them to export to China. What happened? Sales of beef from New Zealand to China soared 478 percent in one year. China surpassed New Zealand\u2019s neighbor Australia as New Zealand\u2019s largest export market, more than twice the size of what is exported from New Zealand to the United States.\nThe fact that it surprised me that it could be so important to know the location and concentration of grass in a field is exactly the point: New Zealand\u2019s farmers had the domain expertise, so they knew what needed to be built and they built it. It\u2019s too much to say that Pasture Meter deserves credit for the full 478 percent increase in beef exports, but local farmers bring it up as one of the important factors.\nWhat happened in New Zealand can and will happen in other industries where there may not be a deep history of big data and analytics, but where there is domain expertise in another industry that knows where and how analytics would add value. The big data applications themselves are easily scalable, can be done broadly around the world, and can be implemented whether or not there is much previous data experience\u2014as was the case for the people in Palmerston, New Zealand, who made equipment for the region\u2019s dairy farmers.\nSilicon Valley builds things that Silicon Valley wants, from nicer taxi services to more photo-sharing apps. But investors and entrepreneurs in Silicon Valley don\u2019t see the world through, say, the eyes of farmers. Thus, they are less likely than a company in the Manawatu Wanganui region of New Zealand\u2019s North Island to recognize the need for and develop a technology that enables greater beef and dairy production for export to China. While Marc Andreessen is as closely identified with Silicon Valley as anybody, he agrees that those fields that are early in their development can and should take root wherever there is deep knowledge about a specific area.\nHe has proposed that Detroit leverage its expertise in automotive mechanics to become \u201cDrone Valley,\u201d and suggests that rather than trying to create more Silicon Valleys, we should hope and plan for the creation of \u201c50 different variations of Silicon Valley, all unique from each other and all focusing on different domains.\u201d\nLarry Summers reinforced Andreessen\u2019s view, telling me, \u201cMy general line is, in essence, there is much more division of labor than there used to be. Strategies for countries, companies, and people are much more about building on your strength than offsetting your weaknesses than it used to be.\u201d\nThis effectively means to stop trying to chase after Silicon Valley and focus on the skills and processes that will unleash the next wave of innovation in fields in which there is already local expertise. My view is that the geographic spread of domain expertise in the industries of the future will ensure that the next stage of globalization produces centers of innovation and commercialization that are more geographically diverse than the last stage, when Silicon Valley enjoyed 20 years of domination.\nThere won\u2019t be a Roman Empire. The thought that software and big data\u2013savvy companies and entrepreneurs in Silicon Valley will reign supreme is not a crazy one, but I think that as big data becomes more widely adopted, it will be more of a commodity that any industry can use. There is a real opportunity for stakeholders with domain expertise to innovate for themselves, and in breathtaking ways.\nBut if they wait too long, some 28-year-olds in California are going to do it instead.\nIn the cases where an industry is too slow to adapt, then eventually more efficient, less expert start-ups (with big data expertise) like Uber will step in and take down companies with decades of domain expertise.\nIn the famous words of H. G. Wells, \u201cAdapt or perish.\u201d\nAlec Ross is the author of The Industries of the Future, to be released next week by Simon & Schuster.

Their answers?", "body": "During two years of intense research for the writing The Industries of the Future, my interviews with dozens of the world\u2019s most successful, powerful people often turned to parenting. We\u2019ve heard people like Carlos Slim, Eric Schmidt and Larry Summers talk about business or the economy, but talking to them about what skills and attributes today\u2019s children will need to compete and succeed in tomorrow\u2019s economy always got them far away from talking points. \nWhile I dedicate an entire chapter to the topic of parenting in The Industries of the Future, I did want to briefly share some common themes that emerged from my research.\n1. Make sure your kids are learning languages, foreign languages as well as a technical, programming, or scientific language. If big data, genomics, cyber, and robotics/AI are among the high-growth industries of the future, then the people who will make their livings in those industries need to be fluent in the coding languages behind them. Coding also teaches children a way to think and solve problems that is still valuable even if the computer programming language changes.\nSimilarly, as the economy grows more global, cultural fluency and the ability to communicate in more than just one language will grow even more important than they are today.\n2. Demand more academic enrichment out of your children\u2019s schools, but don\u2019t rely on them. My mother was nicknamed Becky the Barbarian in part because she was a relentless advocate for her children\u2019s education at school and at home. I did not appreciate it at the time, but that is what enabled a public school kid from West Virginia who had to work as a midnight janitor to achieve the success I have since had in business, government and academia.\nThe business leaders I spoke with suggested we all needed to follow the Becky the Barbarian model. Hold others to account but also hold yourself to account. Do something about it if your school isn\u2019t offering a rigorous education that meets your child\u2019s needs, but also do something about it if the hours after school for your children are spent unproductively. If your child\u2019s school does not teach them a foreign language, computer programming or challenging enough math, there are enough free resources online that you don\u2019t have an excuse as a parent to keep that from your children.\n3. Ingrain your children with a commitment to lifelong learning. The idea that education ends with an undergraduate or graduate university degree is an anachronism. That MBA or masters in electrical engineering that is so difficult to earn will be near-useless 15 years after graduation if there isn\u2019t a commitment to continuing to learn. The pace of change in business has quickened over the past 10 years and is only going to accelerate further. It\u2019s not the strongest who survive, or the most intelligent, but those most adaptable to change. Lifelong learners are the more resilient than anybody else in times of change.\nI\u2019ll conclude by stating the obvious: these three things are not meant to be comprehensive, nor do they account for social, emotional and spiritual development. But in discussions with many of the world\u2019s most successful people in business, these stand-out. Please share what you think are the key attributes today\u2019s children will need to be successful in tomorrow\u2019s economy!\nAlec Ross is the author of The Industries of the Future, to be released in February by Simon & Schuster."}, {"author": "Alec Ross", "headline": "China has a decision to make in 2016, and it's one that matters for the global economy", "body": "It\u2019s a rainy, smoggy day here in Shanghai\u2019s Pudong District.

The bars are full of hard-drinking traders and investors.\nPeople in the United States and Europe checking their portfolio and wondering why their stocks are getting hammered should know that this is all a part of what is happening over here. \n2016 is China\u2019s year of reckoning, as it addresses long-overdue capital market reforms including bringing market reality to the value of its long-inflated currency, the renminbi. \nBehind the macroeconomics is a choice China has to make: does it grow by opening up its country to greater transparency, accountability and playing by global rules, or does it play by its own rules and keep its markets relatively closed and bank on the fact that they can set the conditions for anybody hoping to do business here and access its consumer market of 1.3 billion people.\nSo far, its response has been schizophrenic. On the positive side, the reforms it announced last year allowing for more truth in the value of its currency and interest rates were responsible steps forward. The crackdown against corruption continues, too. Among those who reportedly have been detained in the last few weeks are the chairman of China\u2019s largest private conglomerate and the head of one of its largest fashion companies, estimated to be China\u2019s 34th and 65th richest citizens respectively (by way of companies, Forbes estimates Elon Musk and Eli Broad to be America\u2019s 34th and 65th richest).\nOn the negative side, there are abundant other examples that China is reasserting its control-freak impulses. Last week, the Chinese central bank temporarily suspended certain foreign banks from conducting foreign exchange transactions.\nThe impulse for control continues to reach from central markets to deep into peoples\u2019 personal lives.

If it opens up, it will position itself to better compete in the industries of the future. The devaluation of its currency and unwinding of its old systems will cause short-term economic distress, but it will be worth it. If it tightens up by slowing its reforms and continuing to crack down on free speech and journalism, its growth will slow down further, and there will be more rainy days in Shanghai.\nAlec Ross is the author of The Industries of the Future, to be released in February by Simon & Schuster."}, {"author": "Alec Ross", "headline": "I've traveled the globe, and I'm convinced that these are the cities we'll all want to watch in 2016", "body": "There are all sorts of lists of the best start-ups regions in the world ranking local ecosystems for innovation and entrepreneurship.

STOCKHOLM \nStockholm, Sweden is a lot more than Spotify. It is now the second largest producer of billion dollar start-ups after Silicon Valley on a per capita basis. The thing that stands out about young Swedish companies is the diversity. They\u2019re producing winners in fields as varied as telecommunications, gaming and the Internet of Things. The entrepreneurs and engineers from all over Sweden (with just 9.5 million people) converge on stylish Stockholm when it comes time to start a company.\nWhile I was in government, I noticed that Sweden\u2019s security-focused computer scientists are some of the best in the world. With people becoming ever-more focused on privacy and security, I expect the some of the high-end research and development being done by Swedish engineers to be commercialized in 2016 and find a market almost immediately.  \n2. CAMBRIDGE (NOT MASSACHUSETTS!) \nCambridge, Massachusetts has long been home to start-ups with intellectual roots at MIT and Harvard. It\u2019s now the university town north of London that has the start-up scene that is ready to achieve altitude. Its \u201cSilicon Fen\u201d has been around for some time, producing modest successes. Some of its analytics and biotech companies are among the most exciting in the world. \nThe best indication to me that the UK\u2019s Cambridge was ready to enter the first tier came from hearing the same thing on more than one phone call with world-leading investors. \nMe: Where are you calling from?\nBig Investor: Um, Cambridge University.\nMe: Nice! What are you doing up there?\nBig Investor: Well, uh, just talking to a couple companies.\n3. SEOUL \nSouth Korea is far-better known for its big electronics and automotive companies than it is for its start-ups, but that could soon change given the new maturity of a start-up scene in Seoul many years in the making.\nThe South Korean government is trying to tailor its regulatory environment to be as entrepreneur-friendly as possible. This includes $3.7 billion of spending by government in its start-ups.\nIts aggressive M&A environment allows for entrepreneurs and investors to achieve liquidity more easily than most other Asian markets and allows successful company founders to start that next company. \nMost important is a change in mindset. Following decades of military dictatorship, the safety of a traditional job in a big company was appealing to most Koreans. \u201cStability\u201d was valued above all else. South Koreans who have grown up in its vibrant democracy and always on youth-culture (to be young and Korean is to be LTE-connected) have an entrepreneurial mindset that is more like their peers across the ocean in California than that of their parents.\n4. MARYLAND \nOkay, I\u2019m cheating on this one. I live in Baltimore so my bias to what\u2019s happening in Maryland could stem from it not requiring time on an airplane. Here\u2019s the thing: Maryland is smack-dab in the middle of two fields that are going to see massive investment and commercialization in 2016: security and genomics. \nTo live in Maryland is to live shoulder-to-shoulder with some of the world\u2019s best mathematicians and computer scientists who work at the NSA, CIA or Beltway contractors that sell to government. More and more of these are abandoning the pension and anonymity lifestyle of career government service to start or join start-ups that are bringing individuals and enterprises intelligence-sector-grade cyber security. The NSA\u2019s cafeteria would be chock-a-block with VCs and headhunters, if only they were allowed on campus. \nMaryland is also home to what might be a better bet for 2017 than 2016: the commercialization of genomics. Billions of dollars of R&D $ flow into projects at the National Institutes of Health and Johns Hopkins University to turn our genetic data into \u201cPrecision Medicines\u201d that can tailor therapies to our genetic make-up. 15 years after the mapping of the human genome, we are almost to the point of mainstreaming Precision Medicines and when that happens, a lot of the innovation will come from scientist-rich Maryland.\nAlec Ross is the author of The Industries of the Future, to be released in February by Simon & Schuster."}, {"author": "Alec Ross", "headline": "Big banks once laughed at Bitcoin. Now, Goldman Sachs wants to use its technology.", "body": "Something happened last week that I think is going to change the course of history for Bitcoin and for financial technology more broadly. \nBitcoin has not supplanted traditional currencies the way that some of its early adopters imagined years ago. An early signal that Bitcoin would be hard-pressed to gain mainstream acceptance came in the form of mudballs that were thrown at it from Wall Street. JP Morgan CEO Jamie Dimon made a comment representative of the sentiment of many of his peers when he said, \u201cthe question isn\u2019t whether we accept it. The question is, do we even participate in people who facilitate Bitcoin.\u201d\nFast forward a few years and Wall Street has discovered that the blockchain technology enabling Bitcoin could save the industry tens of billions a year, so instead of throwing mudballs, they\u2019re now figuring out how to use the technology behind Bitcoin. \nI\u2019ve had two conversations with Goldman Sachs CEO Lloyd Blankfein about Bitcoin. In the first, back in 2013, he sort of sneered. In the second conversation, last year, he half-smiled and said, \u201cwe\u2019re looking at its technology.\u201d \nAt its most basic, a blockchain is a distributed database, a sort of ledger, that is protected with encryption and which allows the transfer of goods and services without middlemen. There are a lot of middlemen in the business of transferring payments.\nEarlier this week, Goldman Sachs filed a patent application for a new virtual currency it calls \u201cSETLcoin\u201d which uses blockchain technology.\nWith SETLcoin, Goldman Sachs imagines instantaneous execution and settlement \u201cfor exchanging assets, such as securities (e.g., stocks, bonds, etc.) cash, and/or cash equivalents via a peer-to-peer network\u201d according to it patent filing, wiping out the costs associated with these types of asset exchanges. \nGoldman isn\u2019t going to start doing business in Bitcoin instead of the dollar, euro or renminbi; it\u2019s taking lessons from Bitcoin and using the blockchain as the computer science protocol for its own cryptocurrency.\nIn the same way HTML became the protocol markup language for the World Wide Web, the blockchain may have the technological ingenuity to become the protocol for transactions where there is a need for a high level of trust.\nI expect Goldman Sachs to do away with one of Bitcoin\u2019s defining features: pseudo-anonymity. By using real names and identities on SETLcoin, Goldman Sachs would near-eliminate the kind of fraud and misuse that has plagued Bitcoin. \nThe cypherpunks and cryptolibertarians behind Bitcoin\u2019s creation and early adoption must be pulling their hair out. Bitcoin was created in the wake of the financial crisis to provide anonymous financial tools as an alternative to the dominant banking system.

When I began my career, it was doing jobs like working as midnight janitor and delivering heavy kegs of beer in rural West Virginia working on a beer truck. Still, unlike many people beginning their careers in most places in the world, my country\u2019s politics and economics gave me a close-to-fair shot at becoming successful. It did not matter that I was the grandchild of migrants. \nIt\u2019s worth mentioning that among the developments for which I\u2019m thankful are tools like LinkedIn that allow people to connect in ways that were unimaginable 10 years ago. When I got that job on a beer truck, it was because the owner of the beer distributorship and my grandfather were both the sons of Italian immigrants, and that personal tie got me a job that I otherwise would not have gotten. \nTools like LinkedIn are creating more open marketplaces for work, and making labor less rooted in biology (who is your dad?) or sociology (which country club do you belong to?). Biology and sociology still matter, but the openness fostered by today\u2019s technology platforms make biology and sociology a little less deterministic. \nI hope that Americans gathered around the Thanksgiving dinner table remember that unless you are part of the less than 1% of Native Americans who make up our population today, that you are a descendent of immigrants. And while you, too, might have grown successful or (relatively) comfortable, there are many people in the world who need demonstrations of compassion like what the Wampanoag showed the pilgrims, teaching them how to farm and hunt in the new world.

Just reading the names and sources of wealth gave me motivation, but I was often left without inspiration. Why? I yearned to see someone who looked like me \u2014 someone who was black. I didn\u2019t quite believe I could aspire to the upper heights of wealth without first seeing someone who looked like me do it. Nevertheless, year after year I gobbled up every bit of information from each issue and when media magnate Bob Johnson made the list in 2001, as the first African American Billionaire, I was incredibly proud.\nIn the 15 years since Johnson\u2019s pioneering add, only three other African Americans have joined the exclusive billionaire club. However, in 2017 I believe we\u2019ll see not only the fourth African American to join, but we\u2019ll all witness the first billionaire Bad Boy.\nSean \u201cDiddy\u201d Combs is unquestionably a consummate entrepreneur. I predict his portfolio of Bad Boy Records, Revolt TV, Wine & Spirits, Sean John, AQUAhydrate, and more, currently valued at $750 Million, will see an overall increase in valuation strong enough to push him over the billion dollar mark. However, Diddy becoming a billionaire should not be taken lightly. It\u2019s significance carries major impact, especially in 3 categories:\nHe\u2019ll Be An Economic Pioneer\nCombs will become only the 4th African American to ever make the exclusive billionaire club, instantly making him a black economic pioneer. \u201cThey\u2019ll be what they see\u201d is a powerful mantra of the 100 Black Men organization and for many of the world\u2019s black people, Mr. Combs' triumph becomes another beacon of hope towards our financial empowerment. Despite making great strides over the last several decades, we still lag behind in every economic category, including broad disparities in unemployment and poverty rates. Namely because of Sean Combs' global and multigenerational influence, he is poised to become an inspirational symbol of economic power.\nHe\u2019ll Legitimize The Economic Power Of Hip-Hop\nDiddy becoming a billionaire also helps to legitimize the economic power of hip-hop, still considered a new (and for some) a weakening genre of music. Among all genres of music, hip-hop, founded in just 1973, is still relatively young compared to other popular categories such as rock, pop, and soul. Yet, out of all genres of music, only rock has created a billionaire, with Sir Paul McCartney. The only other musically associated billionaire is theatrical composer, Andrew Lloyd Webber. Sean Combs becoming a billionaire will make him only the 3rd musical artist in history to do so. Not bad coming from a newbie music genre. Further supporting hip-hop\u2019s overall economic power, behind Combs is a long list of rappers and rap producers with substantial wealth. I predict hip-hop artist Jay Z and hip-hop super producer Dr. Dre, with a net worth of $610 million and $700 million respectively, to join the billionaire club in the near future. \nHe\u2019ll Break The Rules Of Massive Wealth Creation\nLastly, Diddy\u2019s diverse portfolio of assets suggests the path to billionaire status doesn\u2019t require the traditional strategy of having only one major source of investment. Of the 1,810 world billionaires, Forbes lists more than 98% deriving the majority of their wealth from a single source (think Bill Gates with Microsoft, Reid Hoffman with LinkedIn, Jeff Bezos with Amazon, etc).

With virtually millions of singles ready to connect, you would think dating should increase. The issue, however, is in that perceived pool of daters, the fact that users of these sites and apps believe there is an endless number of options creates a dangerous psychological effect best described in psychologist's Barry Schwartz\u2019s book Paradox of Choice. Schwartz argues that more is actually less and when presented with more options, we derive less satisfaction and happiness. Moreover, such abundant options often cause an analysis paralysis where we over-analyze or over-think a situation so that a decision or action is never taken. This is precisely what\u2019s happening with dating apps and sites today. Users have what they believe are so many options that they rarely connect with the options they do have (and when they do connect, have little satisfaction with their choices).\n2) Cheapening of Sex\nNever in our lifetime has sex been so easy to come by and at the same time valued so little. At the touch of a mobile phone, you can order anything from pornography to a prostitute. If the cost of the former is too high, one of the thousands of \u201chook-up\u201d apps can deliver you effortless free sex within moments. Just 15 years ago, sex was often the result of effort put forth through courting and committed dating. Today, sex is often expected before dating even begins. As so many people have told me \u201cwhy date when I can remain single and get sex whenever I want it.\u201d  \n3) Drop in Value of Marriage\nThe most alarming statistic foreshadowing the decline of dating comes from a 2014 Pew Research survey that found 67% of millennials no longer see value in getting married. This is an incredibly sobering figure for marriage advocates. Once someone no longer believes they should put effort towards marriage, the prerequisite action of dating becomes no longer necessary. \n4) No One Knows What \u201cDating\u201d Means Anymore\nAsk 10 people to define what dating means and you\u2019ll get 10 different answers. I asked this question recently to my social media community and received a wide range of responses from \u201cjust hanging out\u201d to \u201cit\u2019s like a job interview\u201d to \u201cit means going somewhere exciting.\u201d The fact that there are so many disparate opinions of the word \u201cdating\u201d suggests it no longer has real meaning. For the record, my definition of dating: is an activity two people participate in to either determine if there is serious romantic interest or to further already established serious romantic interest.   \n5) Lack of Belief\nThrough my interactions with singles as clients, at events, and through social media communication, I\u2019ve witnessed a significant shift in belief over the years. When I originally began my career in the love industry 8 years ago, the questions I heard mostly focused on \u201cwhere\u201d or \u201chow\u201d to find a husband or wife. However, over recent years, the overwhelming most popular question from both women and men focuses on \u201cif\" there are any good men or women left. This may seem subtle, but significance can be found in the mindset behind the question. Our belief becomes our reality. If you\u2019re single and doubt a romantic partner exists, you don\u2019t have any motivation to pursue love, let alone go on a date.  \nThis article is part of the LinkedIn Top Voices list, a collection of the must-read writers of the year.

Here\u2019s How I Found Mine.", "body": "There has been no greater impact on my professional, personal, and romantic life than having mentors. That\u2019s right, I have someone\u2019s guidance in every aspect of my life so, yes, I even have a love mentor! The benefit of mentorship hasn\u2019t only been through my role as mentee, I\u2019ve also realized the power of being a mentor, starting in college with the Big Brothers Big Sisters program and continuing through today where I still mentor several people.\nWhile mentorship has a certain meaning to many, it\u2019s not neatly defined, causing confusion about exactly \u201cwhat is a mentoring relationship?\u201d The largest misconception I\u2019ve noticed is the thought you can\u2019t be mentored unless you have an official relationship with someone who confirms they\u2019re your mentor. This is an old and limiting belief. I spent the early part of my business career being mentored by Steve Jobs, Bill Gates, Susan Taylor, & Reginald Lewis. None of them knew it, though. I believe simply listening to someone\u2019s speeches, reading articles and blog posts they\u2019ve written, or exchanging thoughts with them via social media, can all be considered \u201cbeing mentored.\u201d At the end of the day, I define mentorship as a personal development in which a more experienced or more knowledgeable person guides a less experienced or less knowledgeable person.\nThat being said, you won\u2019t get an argument from me about whether formal mentorship is more effective. It\u2019s MUCH more effective! A relationship with established roles and defined expectations always gets optimal results. So how do you structure a formal mentoring relationship, especially with someone who is highly sought after? Well, the first thing to know is while it may seem against conventional thought, whatever you do, please, please, please do not ask someone to be your mentor. Seems strange, right? You would think in order for someone to be a mentor, you would need to ask them.\nThe problem is when we ask we\u2019re typically asking strangers, people we have only met recently, or those we don\u2019t yet have strong bonds with. Sheryl Sandberg, COO of Facebook, sums it up best in her book Lean In:\n\u201cIf someone has to ask the question, the answer is probably no. When someone finds the right mentor, it is obvious.  The question becomes a statement. Chasing or forcing that connection rarely works.\u201d\n So the real question is not so much \u201chow to ask someone to be a mentor\u201d but rather, \u201chow to build a rapport with someone you would like to become your mentor?\u201d Here are the 5 steps I used (as well as steps that were used on me) to seal the deal on my most rewarding mentoring relationships.\n  1. Become Mentee Material\nAre you somebody you yourself would like to mentor? Are you open, flexible, resilient, and respectful? Are you eager to learn, and committed to modifying how you\u2019re interacting in the world so you can have even more success, reward and happiness?\nIf the answer is \u201cno\u201d don\u2019t move to step 2 until you nail this one first. It took several failed mentoring relationships for me to appreciate the importance of becoming mentee material. Be someone who is already actively building his/her life, and is demonstrating that every day.\n  2. Make Sure The Person Shares Your Values\nDon\u2019t simply see their awards and accolades and because you aspire for those same things believe he or she is the right person to guide you. It\u2019s critical that you know your potential mentor has the same values you do. Values are essentially your guidebook to life. If your mentor has different values, it means they play by a different set of rules from you. Some of which you may consider immoral or unethical.\nMost people searching for a mentor don\u2019t focus on values because they either don\u2019t know their own (and so don\u2019t have anything to match against) or don\u2019t want to expend the effort to assess someone else\u2019s values. Determining someone\u2019s values requires dedication. You have to watch actions play out over time. While values are key, I don\u2019t believe any other similarities are critical \u2013 so your mentor doesn\u2019t need to be the same ethnicity, religion, gender, or nationality. My greatest mentors (like Ed Neff pictured above) have all been different from me in many aspects, but we always had the same values in common. Shared values are the single most important matchmaking category for success (and that\u2019s in all relationships \u2013 business, platonic, and romantic). \n  3. Advocate For Their Work!\nTweet their posts, comment in a positive way on their blogs, share their updates, start a discussion on LinkedIn about a post they\u2019ve made, promote and attend a live talk they\u2019re giving, and the list goes on.  In short, offer your unique voice, perspectives, experiences and resources to further the action and conversation that these influencers have sparked.  Understand that you are able to be of service to them, and go out and do it. In particular, show up in their comments \u2013 this is where many people with large followings go to for their \u201coxygen.\u201d Continue to show up, give insight, and provide value, consistently. It\u2019s important to note this step isn\u2019t simply about advocating their work for a few weeks and thinking you\u2019ll be noticed immediately. It takes time and keep in mind, you may never be recognized for being their advocate. It took me 4 years of consistently promoting and attending his independent film events before finally connecting with someone who later became my mentor, Ed Neff. What got me through those many years of advocating with no reciprocation was shifting my mindset to giving with no expectation. \n  4. Elevate Your Value To Them Over Time\nGo beyond the comments and offer ideas, refer new clients or business to them. What finally placed me in a position of strength with Ed was when I introduced him to a potential acquirer of one of his businesses. This increased value will move you from someone your possible mentor sees as merely a member of their audience to a member of their network. It\u2019s this critical step I see so many not do and it\u2019s the one strategic move that will most differentiate you from mentee potential to mentee personified. \n  5. Don\u2019t Ask For Mentorship, Make A Statement\nGoing back to the Sanberg quote above, you\u2019ll know your relationship is in the right place for formal mentorship when you don\u2019t have to \u201cask\u201d but simply say \u2013 \u201cyou\u2019re my mentor.\u201d I recall when I made this same statement to Ed, we were having dinner and towards the end I simply said \u201cthanks for being such a great mentor.\u201d That was 7 years of stellar guidance ago.\nFinding a great (formal) mentor can seem daunting, but start where you are. Begin through the inspiring people you\u2019re already interacting and working with now. Mentors need to be people to whom you have demonstrated your potential \u2013 who know how you think, act, communicate and contribute. And they have to like, trust and believe in you already (why else would they help you?).  They also need to believe with absolute certainty that you\u2019ll put to great use all their input and feedback."}, {"author": "Paul Carrick Brunson", "headline": "It\u2019s Called \u201cNetworking\u201d Not \u201cUsing\u201d", "body": "I worked for Oprah Winfrey and as a result, I've become popular for a particular favor. Daily. Seriously, every single day, I receive a message like the following (from someone I've never met):\n\u201cHi Paul, I\u2019m working on an incredible new project. Can you introduce me to Oprah so I can pitch it to her for funding or to partner with me?\u201d\nI wonder do they really expect my reply to be:\n\u201cSure, let me fire-off an email immediately to her and make an introduction.\u201d\nLet\u2019s get serious folks!\nThe biggest problem people have with networking is going in for the \u201cask\u201d too soon. If your networking strategy is simply about getting what you want, that\u2019s called \u201cusing\u201d not \u201cnetworking\u201d.\nKeep in mind the #1 rule of influence is reciprocity. Doing many somethings for the person you\u2019re building with before you make your ask will dramatically increase your ask getting answered.\nThe most successful relationships I have built are with people I do more for than they do for me. I give, give, give, give, give, then ask.\nSure, networking is about getting what you want but it\u2019s also about making sure the people who are important to you get what they want, too."}, {"author": "Paul Carrick Brunson", "headline": "I've Worked For Two Billionaires. Here's What I Learned From Them.", "body": "I have spent decades \u201cbeing educated\u201d \u2013  in college, graduate school, numerous professional certifications, and now a PhD program. All of that schooling and training helped shape the person I am today, but at no point in my life  has there been a more profound education than my time working for Enver Yucel and Oprah Winfrey.\nEnver and Oprah are two extraordinary people. And on top of that, they\u2019re both billionaires. On the surface, they appear to be totally different people. They are in different industries, have different family structures, practice different religions, and speak different languages. However, once you get past their written biographies and dig deeper, you will notice they possess many of the same successful habits.\nI had the opportunity to work with both Oprah and Enver for 6 years collectively and those were, hands down, the best professional experiences of my life. I worked my ass off for them and in doing so absorbed everything I could.\nIt\u2019s my honor to share with you what I learned from them. Here is Part 1 of the 20 successful habits I learned working for two billionaires:\n  1) Invest in Yourself\nThis is a very simple concept, but something you would think someone who has \u201cmade it\u201d would stop doing. Not at all for these two. I saw them both spend a significant amount of time dedicating their resources to self-development  (whether it be a new language, exercise, social media classes, etc). The moment you stop investing in yourself is the moment you have written off future dividends in life.\n  2) Be Curious\u2026About Everything\nWhat the average person sees as mundane or overly complicated is not viewed the same way with a billionaire mindset. I once had a 30 minute conversation with Enver about the height of the curbs in Washington DC versus Istanbul, Turkey.  Billionaires are incredibly curious; what the rest of the world thinks is a problem and complains about \u2014 that\u2019s what these people go and work on.\n  3) Surround Yourself With \u201cBetter\u201d People\nI hope this is why they kept me around :-). Seriously, I never knew my bosses to keep anyone less-than-stellar in their inner circle. There were many times I thought to myself, \u201cDamn, they have dream-teams built around them.\u201d Jim Rohn had it right, \u201cYou are the average of the 5 people you spend the most time with.\u201d\n  4) Never Eat Alone\nThe last time I had dinner with Enver, as well as the last time I ate dinner with Oprah, there were easily 15 people at our tables, respectively. Coincidence? While most of us derive our key information from blogs or the newspaper, power players get their information from the source (other power players), directly. However, just because you can\u2019t call up the Obamas and break bread with them doesn\u2019t mean eating with others in your circle doesn\u2019t carry value. In one of my favorite reads of the last few years called Never Eat Alone author Keith Ferrazzi breaks down how you can identify \u201cinformation brokers\u201d to dine with you.  I\u2019ve seen first hand how enormous the benefits are of this strategy.\n  5) Take Responsibility For Your Losses\nI was working for Oprah during the time she was taking heat from the media about poor network ratings. I was also working for Enver during the closing of one of his prized divisions. What I witnessed them both do in response was powerful. Opposed to covering the losses up with fancy PR tactics, both stepped to the stage and said in essence \u201cI own it and I\u2019m going to fix it\u201d and dropped the mic. Guess what?  They sure did fix things (It\u2019s widely noted Oprah\u2019s network is realizing ratings gold and Enver\u2019s assets have probably doubled since the division closing).\n  6) Understand The Power Of \u201cLeverage\u201d\nThis is something that was quite a shock to me. From afar, a billionaire appears to be someone who is a master at everything. But, in truth, they\u2019re specialists in one or a few areas and average or subpar at everything else. So, how do they get so much done? Leverage! They do what they do best and get others to do the rest . Here\u2019s a great article on leverage. Keep in mind I see this done with wealthy people and their money all of the time \u2013 they use OPM (other people\u2019s money) for most or all of their projects.\n  7) Take No Days Off (Completely)\nI recall going on vacation with Enver several times, yachting up and down the southwestern coast of Turkey (also known as the blue voyage). Sounds ballerific, right? No doubt we had a great time, but mixed in with all that swimming and backgammon was discussion of business, discussion of strategy, planning and plotting. The best way I can describe this habit is thinking about your business or your idea like your literal baby. No matter your distance, you don\u2019t stop thinking of him/her (and after just having a second son, I can attest to this).\n  8) Focus On Experiences vs. Material Possessions\nWhen you have money, your toys are big. However, the vast majority of money I saw spent on their \u201cleisure\u201d was on actual experiences versus the typical car, jewelry, and clothes we\u2019re familiar with seeing in music videos and gossip blogs. I recall one time at dinner with Oprah, I spotted a table of about 20 girls off to the side. I later found out Ms. Winfrey was treating some of her graduating girls from her school in South Africa to dinner in NYC. Experiences create memories, and memories are priceless.\n  9) Take Enormous Risks\nThis is another one of those successful habits every entrepreneur can attest to. A matter of fact, Entreprenuer.com created a great infographic outlining commonalities of the world\u2019s billionaires and one of the most prominent was this characteristic: billionaires are not adverse to risk. What intrigues me even more about Enver and Oprah was that even at their high financial status and success level, they still possessed a willingness to risk their most precious asset (their name and legacy) on new and bolder projects. If you\u2019re not taking risks, you\u2019re not making moves!\n  10) Don\u2019t Go At It Alone\nNothing great in life is achieved alone. Especially in business, success isn\u2019t a solo act. This character trait is akin to \u201csurrounding yourself with better people.\u201d It takes teamwork to make the dream work.\n  What I witnessed from working for Enver and Oprah were characteristics and successful habits that not only apply to business \u201cwins,\u201d but also translate to general life success. I sincerely hope the tips I\u2019ve shared here will inspire you to create (or maintain) great habits for your success.

Seriously, that\u2019s it. I have the privilege of sitting down one-on-one mostly with people I\u2019ve admired from afar \u2013 business leaders, artists, and change agents. But in a selfish move, to guard my memory of their work, I literally pray nothing will happen that will ruin my appreciation of them or their work.\n  So, when I sat down yesterday with legendary director Spike Lee for a one-on-one interview, I had the same hope. My memory of Spike goes back to his first feature length film \u2018She\u2019s Gotta Have It\u2019 and the one thing I\u2019ve never seen him do over the years is stand down from an issue. With a personality like his, an interview can become complicated because it takes cooperation to make for a good question and answer session. There needs to be willingness from both the interviewer and the interviewee to give and take. A good interview is like watching a couple flawlessly tango.\n  With my single hope, I was focused on doing everything within my control to make my interview with Spike Lee good. As I awaited for him on the set, alongside a group of about a dozen people, I began to think about all the things I had learned over the years in order to direct the interview along the questions and themes I had researched about him. Someone then entered the room and said \u201cSpike just arrived downstairs, he\u2019ll be up in 3 minutes!\u201d As the 3-minute countdown began in my head, I wasn\u2019t nervous, I was in the zone. An edge of super confidence even came over me. I began to think, forget about this simply being good, I would show Spike Lee what a GREAT interview really was. Well, I was ROYALLY mistaken! Little did I know, in 3 minutes, I would get a master class from Spike Lee.\n  Now, less than a full day after the interview, I remain in awe of what I witnessed Spike do, effortlessly. The techniques he used should be studied and considered if you are seeking to quickly place yourself in a position of power in a room of strangers or in an interview.\n  Here are the 10 things I learned from the legendary director Spike Lee on how to control a room (and an interview).\n  1. Have a Powerful Preceding Reputation\nThis is much easier said than done, but it made an impact in the room so I have to mention it. Everyone knows who Spike Lee is and most would agree his brand conjures up thoughts of: intelligence, creativeness, and defiance against the status quo. These descriptors were already on our minds before he entered the room and so, it played a part in his perception once we saw him. Remember that your reputation always precedes you. Control your brand, before you even think about controlling the room.\n  2. Walk in the Room Boldly\nThe moment Spike entered the room, he didn\u2019t stop walking until he landed at his interview chair. He moved with a sense of urgency. I\u2019ve watched countless other power players do the same. Not hesitating when you break the room\u2019s threshold gives the appearance of a true sense of purpose. When you enter a room, go to where you want to be and don\u2019t let anything or anyone interfere with you. Spike sure didn\u2019t.\n  3. Make Eye Contact With Everyone\nAs Spike walked to his chair, he appeared to be surveying the room. I didn\u2019t quite understand it until I saw him sit down. He was actually making eye contact with everyone, individually. There were only about a dozen of us in the room and Spike connected with each person. Most people in the room simply got a quick glance and slight smile, and while appearing minor, these two actions were significant. One of the most important nonverbal signals people use to size you up and figure out your intent is your facial expression. A slight smile and eye contact suggests you\u2019re approachable, but not overly eager.\n  4. Make it Clear You\u2019re On a Tight Timetable\nWhen Spike finished his room survey and sat down, he blurted out in a fun yet serious tone \u201cOkay my people, let\u2019s go, I have to be at \u2018The Daily Show\u2019 soon.\u201d In just a few words, he put everyone on notice that we had a strict deadline. Psychologically, creating a sense of urgency is a master move of a power player. Urgency causes people to act quickly because you stop thinking about the unnecessary and only concentrate on the critical. So all those extra camera shots and scenes we wanted to get with Spike got thrown out the window, he gave us a new mission, just focus on the main interview. It was at this exact moment that I believe Spike \u201ctook control\u201d of the room. He emerged as our leader (after only being in the room for a few minutes and uttering only a handful of words).\n  5. Reference Other Important Projects You\u2019re Involved With\nIf you notice in the prior point, Spike mentioned \u201cThe Daily Show.\u201d Was this by accident? Perhaps, but perhaps not. Strategically dropping a name is much different from bragging, with the latter being about your ego and the former being about the ego of those in the room with you. It\u2019s critical to talk yourself up. Who else is going to do it? Especially when you\u2019re working on important projects. It\u2019s how you manage your brand and in cases like \u201ccontrolling a room,\u201d it works wonders. There we were, the Our World Black Enterprise staff (an amazing TV team that puts on a quality show but we have no where near the budget, audience, or brand of The Daily Show\u2026at least, not yet :-)). So when Spike dropped such a high level brand, he added a sense of competitiveness to our urgency. This again was a great move. To be honest, it made me feel like I had to step up my game. I also felt humbled. Knowing my team and I were in the same media lineup of The Daily Show.\n  6. Be The First To Break The Ice\nWith Spike seated, it was my turn to take my place in the seat across from him. Once within eyesight, I gave him a smile, held out my hand and said \u201cIt\u2019s an honor to meet you Mr. Lee.\u201d I like to build a rapport with my interviewees before the start of the interview, so I was ready to launch into a pre-scripted ice breaker. I had prepared in my mind to ask Spike about the children\u2019s book he and his wife wrote. Especially, since my family owns a copy of the book and I had recently read it to my little boys. But before I could get out my words, with laser quickness, Spike asked me \u201cso, where did you go to school?\u201d I responded, \u201cOld Dominion for undergrad & Georgetown for grad.\u201d He then immediately asked, which team I preferred. I answered \u201cGeorgetown.\u201d As I finished pronouncing the \u201ctown\u201d in Georgetown, he started with his next question about my thoughts on the basketball coach. Long story short, this dude completely flipped the script on me!!! He was leading our pre-interview session. Guiding it where he wanted, at his own pace. Spike broke the ice first. \u201cBreaking the ice\u201d is basically the initial dialogue you have with someone, just the first 1 or 2 exchanges. From what I\u2019ve witnessed, whoever controls those first few exchanges, typically maintains control of the conversation going forward. In this case, Spike beat me to it. So after meeting him just seconds prior, before the camera even began to roll, the legendary director was already controlling the interview.\n  7. Use \u201cPower\u201d Body Language Moves\nOnce the official on air interview began (Spike yelled \u201cAction\u201d, by the way), I noticed something Spike was doing that I first mistook for coyness and later realized it was another masterful control move. We were both seated in swivel chairs and with the ease of a foot push, the chair would swivel from side to side. While I asked him questions, he sat in a squared off position with me \u2013 belly to belly. However, once my question was asked and we began to exchange on the topic, his foot would swivel his chair ever slightly away from me. From being someone who has studied body language for nearly a decade, I\u2019m aware that the movement of someone\u2019s belly button away from you suggests a disinterest but masterful Spike completely remixed this rule. He would focus on me, then move away, then focus on me again, then move away. It was very effective in making me feel as if at certain points I was losing his attention and therefore had to change the flow or subject in order to gain his attention back. He was making me work and controlling the topics of our conversation, by the slight push of his foot.\n  Another body language rule he used quite effectively was pointing his finger. However, instead of what you would typically think, that someone pointing a finger at you is offensive, Spike instead would point his finger upward. I\u2019ve actually not seen that move since I was a little boy and my mother was telling me \u201cno.\u201d By the simple point of his finger as I was talking, it politely signaled for me to pause. It was ridiculously effective and didn\u2019t feel as if he was being rude, at all. To experiment, I used the upward finger pointing move in 3 conversations since the interview and it\u2019s like a magic wand. Whoever you\u2019re talking to just automatically stops talking (I suggest using this sparingly).\n  8. Use the Power Pause\nGoogle any video interview of Spike and you\u2019ll see he does something with his delivery that few people do, especially on a televised interview. He pauses, at will. On TV, at live events, on podcasts, any situation with time limitations, people normally don\u2019t slow down, they actually speed up their cadence. Not only that, from advice I\u2019ve received from some of the best TV producers in the business, the key with interviews is to talk succinctly and drop quick (verbal) bombs \u2013 this reasoning comes from the fact TV is sound bite driven so if you say something quick and clever, chances are it\u2019ll make additional clips of the show (like a commercial tease). No person I\u2019ve ever interviewed has defied this law, except Spike Lee. The funny thing is that a \u201cpower pause\u201d is a technique many interviewers not interviewees use (I first learned about the power pause from watching Barbara Walters. She is notorious for asking a question, getting an answer, and not responding to the answer and like magic, the interviewee sensing the silence, delves deeper in their answer and gives up something they hadn\u2019t shared before). So with the power pause at his disposal, Spike had another tool to control the conversation.\n  9. Don\u2019t Use Fillers\u2026Ever.\nSpike delivered a filler free interview. The bottom line is that the use of \u201cumm,\u201d \u201cyeah,\u201d \u201clike,\u201d etc., destroys the appearance of confidence in your subject matter as well as yourself.\n  10. Make No Apologies\nName drop coming in 3, 2, 1\u2026I remember Oprah telling me that every person she ever interviewed asked her the same question afterwards, \u201cHow did I do?\u201d Over the past 2 years, having interviewed about 60 very prominent artists, business leaders, and change agents, that same question came up, as well. Inevitably, at some point after the interview, the interviewee would lean in close to me, nearly whispering and ask, \u201cPaul, how did I do?\u201d Yesterday, the streak ended. When our interview wrapped, Spike wished my Georgetown basketball team well, thanked me for the interview, and that was that. He gave not even the slight appearance of concern for my impression of the quality of his interview. I respect that. It\u2019s like Kobe Bryant walking off the court and asking someone \u201cwas my game okay?\u201d Power players don\u2019t need a confirmation \u2013 they know if they crushed it or got crushed. Now, is feedback important? Of course it is. But if your primary goal is to control the room, what\u2019s the need for feedback when you already know you\u2019re a legend.\nLike this post?

The most successful people in the world share the following pattern in common: They have ONE thing that sits on their heart, which they embrace (no matter how trivial) as a sole passion. Then, over many years, the ONE passion is developed and ultimately becomes ONE world class skill. Then, that ONE world class skill is applied and opens the doors to an endless number of opportunities to change the world.\nCase in point, meet Gilbert Tuhabonye.\nGilbert's ONE passion is running. Gilbert is a long distance runner born in Songa, Burundi, whose early love for track and field helped him win the Burundi National Championship in the men's 400 and 800 meters while only a junior in high school. This passion helped save his life.\nOn October 21, 1993, members of the Hutu tribe invaded Gilbert's high school and captured the students of the Tutsi tribe. Those not immediately killed were beaten and burned alive in a nearby building. After nine hours buried beneath burning bodies, Gilbert managed to escape and outrun his captors to the safety of a nearby hospital. He was the lone survivor.\nHe came to Texas and kept competing, honing his skills. Recruited by Abilene Christian University, Gilbert earned All-American honors six times. After graduation he moved to Austin, where by all accounts he is the most popular running coach in the city. To drill for water in Burundi, he cofounded the Gazelle Foundation, whose main fundraiser is -- wait for it -- \"Run for the Water,\" a sponsored run through the streets of Austin. Do you see the theme running through his life?\nFrom competitor to survivor, from college to career to charity, Gilbert Tuhabonye's passion for running became a skill that led to a profession that opened up an opportunity to give back. He's a symbol of how ONE passion can become ONE skill, and together ignite and define an extraordinary life."}][{"author": "Paul Carrick Brunson", "headline": "Sean \u201cDiddy\u201d Combs Becomes Hip-Hop\u2019s First Billionaire in 2017", "body": "I had an unusual hobby as a teenager, one of my favorite pastimes was reading Forbes magazine, namely the coveted Forbes Billionaire issue, presenting the world\u2019s wealthiest people. Just reading the names and sources of wealth gave me motivation, but I was often left without inspiration. Why? I yearned to see someone who looked like me \u2014 someone who was black. I didn\u2019t quite believe I could aspire to the upper heights of wealth without first seeing someone who looked like me do it. Nevertheless, year after year I gobbled up every bit of information from each issue and when media magnate Bob Johnson made the list in 2001, as the first African American Billionaire, I was incredibly proud.\nIn the 15 years since Johnson\u2019s pioneering add, only three other African Americans have joined the exclusive billionaire club. However, in 2017 I believe we\u2019ll see not only the fourth African American to join, but we\u2019ll all witness the first billionaire Bad Boy.\nSean \u201cDiddy\u201d Combs is unquestionably a consummate entrepreneur. I predict his portfolio of Bad Boy Records, Revolt TV, Wine & Spirits, Sean John, AQUAhydrate, and more, currently valued at $750 Million, will see an overall increase in valuation strong enough to push him over the billion dollar mark. However, Diddy becoming a billionaire should not be taken lightly. It\u2019s significance carries major impact, especially in 3 categories:\nHe\u2019ll Be An Economic Pioneer\nCombs will become only the 4th African American to ever make the exclusive billionaire club, instantly making him a black economic pioneer. \u201cThey\u2019ll be what they see\u201d is a powerful mantra of the 100 Black Men organization and for many of the world\u2019s black people, Mr. Combs' triumph becomes another beacon of hope towards our financial empowerment. Despite making great strides over the last several decades, we still lag behind in every economic category, including broad disparities in unemployment and poverty rates. Namely because of Sean Combs' global and multigenerational influence, he is poised to become an inspirational symbol of economic power.\nHe\u2019ll Legitimize The Economic Power Of Hip-Hop\nDiddy becoming a billionaire also helps to legitimize the economic power of hip-hop, still considered a new (and for some) a weakening genre of music. Among all genres of music, hip-hop, founded in just 1973, is still relatively young compared to other popular categories such as rock, pop, and soul. Yet, out of all genres of music, only rock has created a billionaire, with Sir Paul McCartney. The only other musically associated billionaire is theatrical composer, Andrew Lloyd Webber. Sean Combs becoming a billionaire will make him only the 3rd musical artist in history to do so. Not bad coming from a newbie music genre. Further supporting hip-hop\u2019s overall economic power, behind Combs is a long list of rappers and rap producers with substantial wealth. I predict hip-hop artist Jay Z and hip-hop super producer Dr. Dre, with a net worth of $610 million and $700 million respectively, to join the billionaire club in the near future. \nHe\u2019ll Break The Rules Of Massive Wealth Creation\nLastly, Diddy\u2019s diverse portfolio of assets suggests the path to billionaire status doesn\u2019t require the traditional strategy of having only one major source of investment. Of the 1,810 world billionaires, Forbes lists more than 98% deriving the majority of their wealth from a single source (think Bill Gates with Microsoft, Reid Hoffman with LinkedIn, Jeff Bezos with Amazon, etc). Sean Combs is the exception to the traditional billionaire \u201cwealth source\u201d rule. His diversified portfolio of music, spirits, clothing, media, & startup investments equally contribute to his wealth. Sean \u201cDiddy\u201d Combs proves that Bad Boys who break the rules don\u2019t have to finish last. \nThis article is part of the LinkedIn Top Voices list, a collection of the must-read writers of the year.

While my stance on the importance of companionship and marriage remain unchanged, it\u2019s become clear that \u201cdating\u201d as we traditionally understand it, has forever changed.\nAll trends suggest a significant decrease in dating around the world. This, compounded by research that suggests the average single doesn\u2019t go on one date in a year, will result in what I believe to be the most significant drop in the percentage of people who date ever seen in modern history. I believe 80% of singles will not go on one date in 2017. There are five factors driving the global dating decline:\n1) Dating App Analysis Paralysis\nThere are literally thousands of mobile dating apps and websites, so many that for any niche or abstract interest you can think of, there is most likely a dating site for it. With virtually millions of singles ready to connect, you would think dating should increase. The issue, however, is in that perceived pool of daters, the fact that users of these sites and apps believe there is an endless number of options creates a dangerous psychological effect best described in psychologist's Barry Schwartz\u2019s book Paradox of Choice. Schwartz argues that more is actually less and when presented with more options, we derive less satisfaction and happiness. Moreover, such abundant options often cause an analysis paralysis where we over-analyze or over-think a situation so that a decision or action is never taken. This is precisely what\u2019s happening with dating apps and sites today. Users have what they believe are so many options that they rarely connect with the options they do have (and when they do connect, have little satisfaction with their choices).\n2) Cheapening of Sex\nNever in our lifetime has sex been so easy to come by and at the same time valued so little. At the touch of a mobile phone, you can order anything from pornography to a prostitute. If the cost of the former is too high, one of the thousands of \u201chook-up\u201d apps can deliver you effortless free sex within moments. Just 15 years ago, sex was often the result of effort put forth through courting and committed dating. Today, sex is often expected before dating even begins. As so many people have told me \u201cwhy date when I can remain single and get sex whenever I want it.\u201d  \n3) Drop in Value of Marriage\nThe most alarming statistic foreshadowing the decline of dating comes from a 2014 Pew Research survey that found 67% of millennials no longer see value in getting married. This is an incredibly sobering figure for marriage advocates. Once someone no longer believes they should put effort towards marriage, the prerequisite action of dating becomes no longer necessary. \n4) No One Knows What \u201cDating\u201d Means Anymore\nAsk 10 people to define what dating means and you\u2019ll get 10 different answers. I asked this question recently to my social media community and received a wide range of responses from \u201cjust hanging out\u201d to \u201cit\u2019s like a job interview\u201d to \u201cit means going somewhere exciting.\u201d The fact that there are so many disparate opinions of the word \u201cdating\u201d suggests it no longer has real meaning. For the record, my definition of dating: is an activity two people participate in to either determine if there is serious romantic interest or to further already established serious romantic interest.   \n5) Lack of Belief\nThrough my interactions with singles as clients, at events, and through social media communication, I\u2019ve witnessed a significant shift in belief over the years. When I originally began my career in the love industry 8 years ago, the questions I heard mostly focused on \u201cwhere\u201d or \u201chow\u201d to find a husband or wife. However, over recent years, the overwhelming most popular question from both women and men focuses on \u201cif\" there are any good men or women left. This may seem subtle, but significance can be found in the mindset behind the question. Our belief becomes our reality. If you\u2019re single and doubt a romantic partner exists, you don\u2019t have any motivation to pursue love, let alone go on a date.  \nThis article is part of the LinkedIn Top Voices list, a collection of the must-read writers of the year.

Here\u2019s How I Found Mine.", "body": "There has been no greater impact on my professional, personal, and romantic life than having mentors. That\u2019s right, I have someone\u2019s guidance in every aspect of my life so, yes, I even have a love mentor! The benefit of mentorship hasn\u2019t only been through my role as mentee, I\u2019ve also realized the power of being a mentor, starting in college with the Big Brothers Big Sisters program and continuing through today where I still mentor several people.\nWhile mentorship has a certain meaning to many, it\u2019s not neatly defined, causing confusion about exactly \u201cwhat is a mentoring relationship?\u201d The largest misconception I\u2019ve noticed is the thought you can\u2019t be mentored unless you have an official relationship with someone who confirms they\u2019re your mentor. This is an old and limiting belief. I spent the early part of my business career being mentored by Steve Jobs, Bill Gates, Susan Taylor, & Reginald Lewis. None of them knew it, though. I believe simply listening to someone\u2019s speeches, reading articles and blog posts they\u2019ve written, or exchanging thoughts with them via social media, can all be considered \u201cbeing mentored.\u201d At the end of the day, I define mentorship as a personal development in which a more experienced or more knowledgeable person guides a less experienced or less knowledgeable person.\nThat being said, you won\u2019t get an argument from me about whether formal mentorship is more effective. It\u2019s MUCH more effective! A relationship with established roles and defined expectations always gets optimal results. So how do you structure a formal mentoring relationship, especially with someone who is highly sought after? Well, the first thing to know is while it may seem against conventional thought, whatever you do, please, please, please do not ask someone to be your mentor. Seems strange, right? You would think in order for someone to be a mentor, you would need to ask them.\nThe problem is when we ask we\u2019re typically asking strangers, people we have only met recently, or those we don\u2019t yet have strong bonds with. Sheryl Sandberg, COO of Facebook, sums it up best in her book Lean In:\n\u201cIf someone has to ask the question, the answer is probably no. When someone finds the right mentor, it is obvious.  The question becomes a statement. Chasing or forcing that connection rarely works.\u201d\n So the real question is not so much \u201chow to ask someone to be a mentor\u201d but rather, \u201chow to build a rapport with someone you would like to become your mentor?\u201d Here are the 5 steps I used (as well as steps that were used on me) to seal the deal on my most rewarding mentoring relationships.\n  1. Become Mentee Material\nAre you somebody you yourself would like to mentor? Are you open, flexible, resilient, and respectful? Are you eager to learn, and committed to modifying how you\u2019re interacting in the world so you can have even more success, reward and happiness?\nIf the answer is \u201cno\u201d don\u2019t move to step 2 until you nail this one first. It took several failed mentoring relationships for me to appreciate the importance of becoming mentee material. Be someone who is already actively building his/her life, and is demonstrating that every day.\n  2. Make Sure The Person Shares Your Values\nDon\u2019t simply see their awards and accolades and because you aspire for those same things believe he or she is the right person to guide you. It\u2019s critical that you know your potential mentor has the same values you do. Values are essentially your guidebook to life. If your mentor has different values, it means they play by a different set of rules from you. Some of which you may consider immoral or unethical.\nMost people searching for a mentor don\u2019t focus on values because they either don\u2019t know their own (and so don\u2019t have anything to match against) or don\u2019t want to expend the effort to assess someone else\u2019s values. Determining someone\u2019s values requires dedication. You have to watch actions play out over time. While values are key, I don\u2019t believe any other similarities are critical \u2013 so your mentor doesn\u2019t need to be the same ethnicity, religion, gender, or nationality. My greatest mentors (like Ed Neff pictured above) have all been different from me in many aspects, but we always had the same values in common. Shared values are the single most important matchmaking category for success (and that\u2019s in all relationships \u2013 business, platonic, and romantic). \n  3. Advocate For Their Work!\nTweet their posts, comment in a positive way on their blogs, share their updates, start a discussion on LinkedIn about a post they\u2019ve made, promote and attend a live talk they\u2019re giving, and the list goes on.  In short, offer your unique voice, perspectives, experiences and resources to further the action and conversation that these influencers have sparked.  Understand that you are able to be of service to them, and go out and do it. In particular, show up in their comments \u2013 this is where many people with large followings go to for their \u201coxygen.\u201d Continue to show up, give insight, and provide value, consistently. It\u2019s important to note this step isn\u2019t simply about advocating their work for a few weeks and thinking you\u2019ll be noticed immediately. It takes time and keep in mind, you may never be recognized for being their advocate. It took me 4 years of consistently promoting and attending his independent film events before finally connecting with someone who later became my mentor, Ed Neff. What got me through those many years of advocating with no reciprocation was shifting my mindset to giving with no expectation. \n  4. Elevate Your Value To Them Over Time\nGo beyond the comments and offer ideas, refer new clients or business to them. What finally placed me in a position of strength with Ed was when I introduced him to a potential acquirer of one of his businesses. This increased value will move you from someone your possible mentor sees as merely a member of their audience to a member of their network. It\u2019s this critical step I see so many not do and it\u2019s the one strategic move that will most differentiate you from mentee potential to mentee personified. \n  5. Don\u2019t Ask For Mentorship, Make A Statement\nGoing back to the Sanberg quote above, you\u2019ll know your relationship is in the right place for formal mentorship when you don\u2019t have to \u201cask\u201d but simply say \u2013 \u201cyou\u2019re my mentor.\u201d I recall when I made this same statement to Ed, we were having dinner and towards the end I simply said \u201cthanks for being such a great mentor.\u201d That was 7 years of stellar guidance ago.\nFinding a great (formal) mentor can seem daunting, but start where you are. Begin through the inspiring people you\u2019re already interacting and working with now. Mentors need to be people to whom you have demonstrated your potential \u2013 who know how you think, act, communicate and contribute. And they have to like, trust and believe in you already (why else would they help you?).  They also need to believe with absolute certainty that you\u2019ll put to great use all their input and feedback."}, {"author": "Paul Carrick Brunson", "headline": "It\u2019s Called \u201cNetworking\u201d Not \u201cUsing\u201d", "body": "I worked for Oprah Winfrey and as a result, I've become popular for a particular favor.

Can you introduce me to Oprah so I can pitch it to her for funding or to partner with me?\u201d\nI wonder do they really expect my reply to be:\n\u201cSure, let me fire-off an email immediately to her and make an introduction.\u201d\nLet\u2019s get serious folks!\nThe biggest problem people have with networking is going in for the \u201cask\u201d too soon.

Doing many somethings for the person you\u2019re building with before you make your ask will dramatically increase your ask getting answered.\nThe most successful relationships I have built are with people I do more for than they do for me.

Here's What I Learned From Them.", "body": "I have spent decades \u201cbeing educated\u201d \u2013  in college, graduate school, numerous professional certifications, and now a PhD program. All of that schooling and training helped shape the person I am today, but at no point in my life  has there been a more profound education than my time working for Enver Yucel and Oprah Winfrey.\nEnver and Oprah are two extraordinary people. And on top of that, they\u2019re both billionaires. On the surface, they appear to be totally different people. They are in different industries, have different family structures, practice different religions, and speak different languages. However, once you get past their written biographies and dig deeper, you will notice they possess many of the same successful habits.\nI had the opportunity to work with both Oprah and Enver for 6 years collectively and those were, hands down, the best professional experiences of my life. I worked my ass off for them and in doing so absorbed everything I could.\nIt\u2019s my honor to share with you what I learned from them. Here is Part 1 of the 20 successful habits I learned working for two billionaires:\n  1) Invest in Yourself\nThis is a very simple concept, but something you would think someone who has \u201cmade it\u201d would stop doing. Not at all for these two. I saw them both spend a significant amount of time dedicating their resources to self-development  (whether it be a new language, exercise, social media classes, etc). The moment you stop investing in yourself is the moment you have written off future dividends in life.\n  2) Be Curious\u2026About Everything\nWhat the average person sees as mundane or overly complicated is not viewed the same way with a billionaire mindset. I once had a 30 minute conversation with Enver about the height of the curbs in Washington DC versus Istanbul, Turkey.  Billionaires are incredibly curious; what the rest of the world thinks is a problem and complains about \u2014 that\u2019s what these people go and work on.\n  3) Surround Yourself With \u201cBetter\u201d People\nI hope this is why they kept me around :-). Seriously, I never knew my bosses to keep anyone less-than-stellar in their inner circle. There were many times I thought to myself, \u201cDamn, they have dream-teams built around them.\u201d Jim Rohn had it right, \u201cYou are the average of the 5 people you spend the most time with.\u201d\n  4) Never Eat Alone\nThe last time I had dinner with Enver, as well as the last time I ate dinner with Oprah, there were easily 15 people at our tables, respectively. Coincidence? While most of us derive our key information from blogs or the newspaper, power players get their information from the source (other power players), directly. However, just because you can\u2019t call up the Obamas and break bread with them doesn\u2019t mean eating with others in your circle doesn\u2019t carry value. In one of my favorite reads of the last few years called Never Eat Alone author Keith Ferrazzi breaks down how you can identify \u201cinformation brokers\u201d to dine with you.  I\u2019ve seen first hand how enormous the benefits are of this strategy.\n  5) Take Responsibility For Your Losses\nI was working for Oprah during the time she was taking heat from the media about poor network ratings. I was also working for Enver during the closing of one of his prized divisions. What I witnessed them both do in response was powerful. Opposed to covering the losses up with fancy PR tactics, both stepped to the stage and said in essence \u201cI own it and I\u2019m going to fix it\u201d and dropped the mic. Guess what?  They sure did fix things (It\u2019s widely noted Oprah\u2019s network is realizing ratings gold and Enver\u2019s assets have probably doubled since the division closing).\n  6) Understand The Power Of \u201cLeverage\u201d\nThis is something that was quite a shock to me. From afar, a billionaire appears to be someone who is a master at everything. But, in truth, they\u2019re specialists in one or a few areas and average or subpar at everything else. So, how do they get so much done? Leverage! They do what they do best and get others to do the rest . Here\u2019s a great article on leverage. Keep in mind I see this done with wealthy people and their money all of the time \u2013 they use OPM (other people\u2019s money) for most or all of their projects.\n  7) Take No Days Off (Completely)\nI recall going on vacation with Enver several times, yachting up and down the southwestern coast of Turkey (also known as the blue voyage). Sounds ballerific, right? No doubt we had a great time, but mixed in with all that swimming and backgammon was discussion of business, discussion of strategy, planning and plotting. The best way I can describe this habit is thinking about your business or your idea like your literal baby. No matter your distance, you don\u2019t stop thinking of him/her (and after just having a second son, I can attest to this).\n  8) Focus On Experiences vs. Material Possessions\nWhen you have money, your toys are big. However, the vast majority of money I saw spent on their \u201cleisure\u201d was on actual experiences versus the typical car, jewelry, and clothes we\u2019re familiar with seeing in music videos and gossip blogs. I recall one time at dinner with Oprah, I spotted a table of about 20 girls off to the side. I later found out Ms. Winfrey was treating some of her graduating girls from her school in South Africa to dinner in NYC. Experiences create memories, and memories are priceless.\n  9) Take Enormous Risks\nThis is another one of those successful habits every entrepreneur can attest to. A matter of fact, Entreprenuer.com created a great infographic outlining commonalities of the world\u2019s billionaires and one of the most prominent was this characteristic: billionaires are not adverse to risk. What intrigues me even more about Enver and Oprah was that even at their high financial status and success level, they still possessed a willingness to risk their most precious asset (their name and legacy) on new and bolder projects. If you\u2019re not taking risks, you\u2019re not making moves!\n  10) Don\u2019t Go At It Alone\nNothing great in life is achieved alone. Especially in business, success isn\u2019t a solo act. This character trait is akin to \u201csurrounding yourself with better people.\u201d It takes teamwork to make the dream work.\n  What I witnessed from working for Enver and Oprah were characteristics and successful habits that not only apply to business \u201cwins,\u201d but also translate to general life success. I sincerely hope the tips I\u2019ve shared here will inspire you to create (or maintain) great habits for your success.

Seriously, that\u2019s it. I have the privilege of sitting down one-on-one mostly with people I\u2019ve admired from afar \u2013 business leaders, artists, and change agents. But in a selfish move, to guard my memory of their work, I literally pray nothing will happen that will ruin my appreciation of them or their work.\n  So, when I sat down yesterday with legendary director Spike Lee for a one-on-one interview, I had the same hope. My memory of Spike goes back to his first feature length film \u2018She\u2019s Gotta Have It\u2019 and the one thing I\u2019ve never seen him do over the years is stand down from an issue. With a personality like his, an interview can become complicated because it takes cooperation to make for a good question and answer session. There needs to be willingness from both the interviewer and the interviewee to give and take. A good interview is like watching a couple flawlessly tango.\n  With my single hope, I was focused on doing everything within my control to make my interview with Spike Lee good. As I awaited for him on the set, alongside a group of about a dozen people, I began to think about all the things I had learned over the years in order to direct the interview along the questions and themes I had researched about him. Someone then entered the room and said \u201cSpike just arrived downstairs, he\u2019ll be up in 3 minutes!\u201d As the 3-minute countdown began in my head, I wasn\u2019t nervous, I was in the zone. An edge of super confidence even came over me. I began to think, forget about this simply being good, I would show Spike Lee what a GREAT interview really was. Well, I was ROYALLY mistaken! Little did I know, in 3 minutes, I would get a master class from Spike Lee.\n  Now, less than a full day after the interview, I remain in awe of what I witnessed Spike do, effortlessly. The techniques he used should be studied and considered if you are seeking to quickly place yourself in a position of power in a room of strangers or in an interview.\n  Here are the 10 things I learned from the legendary director Spike Lee on how to control a room (and an interview).\n  1. Have a Powerful Preceding Reputation\nThis is much easier said than done, but it made an impact in the room so I have to mention it. Everyone knows who Spike Lee is and most would agree his brand conjures up thoughts of: intelligence, creativeness, and defiance against the status quo. These descriptors were already on our minds before he entered the room and so, it played a part in his perception once we saw him. Remember that your reputation always precedes you. Control your brand, before you even think about controlling the room.\n  2. Walk in the Room Boldly\nThe moment Spike entered the room, he didn\u2019t stop walking until he landed at his interview chair. He moved with a sense of urgency. I\u2019ve watched countless other power players do the same. Not hesitating when you break the room\u2019s threshold gives the appearance of a true sense of purpose. When you enter a room, go to where you want to be and don\u2019t let anything or anyone interfere with you. Spike sure didn\u2019t.\n  3. Make Eye Contact With Everyone\nAs Spike walked to his chair, he appeared to be surveying the room. I didn\u2019t quite understand it until I saw him sit down. He was actually making eye contact with everyone, individually. There were only about a dozen of us in the room and Spike connected with each person. Most people in the room simply got a quick glance and slight smile, and while appearing minor, these two actions were significant. One of the most important nonverbal signals people use to size you up and figure out your intent is your facial expression. A slight smile and eye contact suggests you\u2019re approachable, but not overly eager.\n  4. Make it Clear You\u2019re On a Tight Timetable\nWhen Spike finished his room survey and sat down, he blurted out in a fun yet serious tone \u201cOkay my people, let\u2019s go, I have to be at \u2018The Daily Show\u2019 soon.\u201d In just a few words, he put everyone on notice that we had a strict deadline. Psychologically, creating a sense of urgency is a master move of a power player. Urgency causes people to act quickly because you stop thinking about the unnecessary and only concentrate on the critical. So all those extra camera shots and scenes we wanted to get with Spike got thrown out the window, he gave us a new mission, just focus on the main interview. It was at this exact moment that I believe Spike \u201ctook control\u201d of the room. He emerged as our leader (after only being in the room for a few minutes and uttering only a handful of words).\n  5. Reference Other Important Projects You\u2019re Involved With\nIf you notice in the prior point, Spike mentioned \u201cThe Daily Show.\u201d Was this by accident? Perhaps, but perhaps not. Strategically dropping a name is much different from bragging, with the latter being about your ego and the former being about the ego of those in the room with you. It\u2019s critical to talk yourself up. Who else is going to do it? Especially when you\u2019re working on important projects. It\u2019s how you manage your brand and in cases like \u201ccontrolling a room,\u201d it works wonders. There we were, the Our World Black Enterprise staff (an amazing TV team that puts on a quality show but we have no where near the budget, audience, or brand of The Daily Show\u2026at least, not yet :-)). So when Spike dropped such a high level brand, he added a sense of competitiveness to our urgency. This again was a great move. To be honest, it made me feel like I had to step up my game. I also felt humbled. Knowing my team and I were in the same media lineup of The Daily Show.\n  6. Be The First To Break The Ice\nWith Spike seated, it was my turn to take my place in the seat across from him. Once within eyesight, I gave him a smile, held out my hand and said \u201cIt\u2019s an honor to meet you Mr. Lee.\u201d I like to build a rapport with my interviewees before the start of the interview, so I was ready to launch into a pre-scripted ice breaker. I had prepared in my mind to ask Spike about the children\u2019s book he and his wife wrote. Especially, since my family owns a copy of the book and I had recently read it to my little boys. But before I could get out my words, with laser quickness, Spike asked me \u201cso, where did you go to school?\u201d I responded, \u201cOld Dominion for undergrad & Georgetown for grad.\u201d He then immediately asked, which team I preferred. I answered \u201cGeorgetown.\u201d As I finished pronouncing the \u201ctown\u201d in Georgetown, he started with his next question about my thoughts on the basketball coach. Long story short, this dude completely flipped the script on me!!! He was leading our pre-interview session. Guiding it where he wanted, at his own pace. Spike broke the ice first. \u201cBreaking the ice\u201d is basically the initial dialogue you have with someone, just the first 1 or 2 exchanges. From what I\u2019ve witnessed, whoever controls those first few exchanges, typically maintains control of the conversation going forward. In this case, Spike beat me to it. So after meeting him just seconds prior, before the camera even began to roll, the legendary director was already controlling the interview.\n  7. Use \u201cPower\u201d Body Language Moves\nOnce the official on air interview began (Spike yelled \u201cAction\u201d, by the way), I noticed something Spike was doing that I first mistook for coyness and later realized it was another masterful control move. We were both seated in swivel chairs and with the ease of a foot push, the chair would swivel from side to side. While I asked him questions, he sat in a squared off position with me \u2013 belly to belly. However, once my question was asked and we began to exchange on the topic, his foot would swivel his chair ever slightly away from me. From being someone who has studied body language for nearly a decade, I\u2019m aware that the movement of someone\u2019s belly button away from you suggests a disinterest but masterful Spike completely remixed this rule. He would focus on me, then move away, then focus on me again, then move away. It was very effective in making me feel as if at certain points I was losing his attention and therefore had to change the flow or subject in order to gain his attention back. He was making me work and controlling the topics of our conversation, by the slight push of his foot.\n  Another body language rule he used quite effectively was pointing his finger. However, instead of what you would typically think, that someone pointing a finger at you is offensive, Spike instead would point his finger upward. I\u2019ve actually not seen that move since I was a little boy and my mother was telling me \u201cno.\u201d By the simple point of his finger as I was talking, it politely signaled for me to pause. It was ridiculously effective and didn\u2019t feel as if he was being rude, at all. To experiment, I used the upward finger pointing move in 3 conversations since the interview and it\u2019s like a magic wand. Whoever you\u2019re talking to just automatically stops talking (I suggest using this sparingly).\n  8. Use the Power Pause\nGoogle any video interview of Spike and you\u2019ll see he does something with his delivery that few people do, especially on a televised interview. He pauses, at will. On TV, at live events, on podcasts, any situation with time limitations, people normally don\u2019t slow down, they actually speed up their cadence. Not only that, from advice I\u2019ve received from some of the best TV producers in the business, the key with interviews is to talk succinctly and drop quick (verbal) bombs \u2013 this reasoning comes from the fact TV is sound bite driven so if you say something quick and clever, chances are it\u2019ll make additional clips of the show (like a commercial tease). No person I\u2019ve ever interviewed has defied this law, except Spike Lee. The funny thing is that a \u201cpower pause\u201d is a technique many interviewers not interviewees use (I first learned about the power pause from watching Barbara Walters. She is notorious for asking a question, getting an answer, and not responding to the answer and like magic, the interviewee sensing the silence, delves deeper in their answer and gives up something they hadn\u2019t shared before). So with the power pause at his disposal, Spike had another tool to control the conversation.\n  9. Don\u2019t Use Fillers\u2026Ever.\nSpike delivered a filler free interview. The bottom line is that the use of \u201cumm,\u201d \u201cyeah,\u201d \u201clike,\u201d etc., destroys the appearance of confidence in your subject matter as well as yourself.\n  10. Make No Apologies\nName drop coming in 3, 2, 1\u2026I remember Oprah telling me that every person she ever interviewed asked her the same question afterwards, \u201cHow did I do?\u201d Over the past 2 years, having interviewed about 60 very prominent artists, business leaders, and change agents, that same question came up, as well. Inevitably, at some point after the interview, the interviewee would lean in close to me, nearly whispering and ask, \u201cPaul, how did I do?\u201d Yesterday, the streak ended. When our interview wrapped, Spike wished my Georgetown basketball team well, thanked me for the interview, and that was that. He gave not even the slight appearance of concern for my impression of the quality of his interview. I respect that. It\u2019s like Kobe Bryant walking off the court and asking someone \u201cwas my game okay?\u201d Power players don\u2019t need a confirmation \u2013 they know if they crushed it or got crushed. Now, is feedback important? Of course it is. But if your primary goal is to control the room, what\u2019s the need for feedback when you already know you\u2019re a legend.\nLike this post?

The most successful people in the world share the following pattern in common: They have ONE thing that sits on their heart, which they embrace (no matter how trivial) as a sole passion. Then, over many years, the ONE passion is developed and ultimately becomes ONE world class skill. Then, that ONE world class skill is applied and opens the doors to an endless number of opportunities to change the world.\nCase in point, meet Gilbert Tuhabonye.\nGilbert's ONE passion is running. Gilbert is a long distance runner born in Songa, Burundi, whose early love for track and field helped him win the Burundi National Championship in the men's 400 and 800 meters while only a junior in high school. This passion helped save his life.\nOn October 21, 1993, members of the Hutu tribe invaded Gilbert's high school and captured the students of the Tutsi tribe. Those not immediately killed were beaten and burned alive in a nearby building. After nine hours buried beneath burning bodies, Gilbert managed to escape and outrun his captors to the safety of a nearby hospital. He was the lone survivor.\nHe came to Texas and kept competing, honing his skills. Recruited by Abilene Christian University, Gilbert earned All-American honors six times. After graduation he moved to Austin, where by all accounts he is the most popular running coach in the city. To drill for water in Burundi, he cofounded the Gazelle Foundation, whose main fundraiser is -- wait for it -- \"Run for the Water,\" a sponsored run through the streets of Austin. Do you see the theme running through his life?\nFrom competitor to survivor, from college to career to charity, Gilbert Tuhabonye's passion for running became a skill that led to a profession that opened up an opportunity to give back. He's a symbol of how ONE passion can become ONE skill, and together ignite and define an extraordinary life."}][{"author": "Ryan Holiday", "headline": "An ancient guide to solving all work problems once and for all", "body": "The image of the Zen philosopher is the monk up in the green, quiet hills, or in a beautiful temple on some rocky cliff. The Stoic, on the other hand, is the antithesis of this idea. The Stoic is the man in the marketplace, the merchant on a voyage, the senator in the Forum, the soldier at the front. In other words, they are like you.\nThose jobs might not seem like one well-suited for \u201cphilosophy,\u201d but they are. And so are you. For in even the most modern seeming professions, a Stoic is able to peace and clarity. For thousands of years, Stoicism has been a tool for the ordinary and the elite alive\u2014from slaves to emperors\u2014as they sought wisdom, strength and the \u2018good life.\u2019 It was philosophy designed for action--for doers--not for the classroom.\nWhich is why it has been popular with everyone from Marcus Aurelius and Seneca (one of the richest men in Rome), to Theodore Roosevelt, Frederick the Great and Michel de Montaigne. More recently, Stoicism has been cited by investors like Tim Ferriss and executives like Jonathan Newhouse, the CEO of Cond\u00e9 Nast International. Even football coaches like Pete Carroll of the Seattle Seahawks and baseball managers like Jeff Banister of the Texas Rangers have recommended Stoicism to their players.\nHow can we follow in their timeless footsteps? How can we reap the benefits of this operating system in our own workplace? It\u2019s simple. Go to straight to the sources. Below are Stoic exercises and strategies, pulled from the new book The Daily Stoic (and daily email at DailyStoic.com), that will help you navigate your workplace with better clarity, effectiveness, and peace of mind.\nDON\u2019T MAKE THINGS HARDER THAN THEY NEED TO BE\n\u201cIf someone asks you how to write your name, would you bark out each letter? And if they get angry, would you then return the anger? Wouldn\u2019t you rather gently spell out each letter for them? So then, remember in life that your duties are the sum of individual acts. Pay attention to each of these as you do your duty . . . just methodically complete your task.\u201d\u2014Marcus Aurelius, Meditations, 6.26\nHere\u2019s a common scenario. You\u2019re working with a frustrating coworker or a difficult boss. They ask you to do something and, because you dislike the messenger, you immediately object. There\u2019s this problem or that one, or their request is obnoxious and rude. So you tell them, \u201cNo, I\u2019m not going to do it.\u201d Then they retaliate by not doing something that you had previously asked of them. And so the conflict escalates.\nMeanwhile, if you could step back and see it objectively, you\u2019d probably see that not everything they\u2019re asking for is unreasonable. In fact, some of it is pretty easy to do or is, at least, agreeable. And if you did it, it might make the rest of the tasks a bit more tolerable too. Pretty soon, you\u2019ve done the entire thing.\nLife (and our job) is difficult enough. Let\u2019s not make it harder by getting emotional about insignificant matters or digging in for battles we don\u2019t actually care about. Let\u2019s not let emotion get in the way of kathe\u0302kon, the simple, appropriate actions on the path to virtue.\nIMPOSSIBLE WITHOUT YOUR CONSENT\n\u201cToday I escaped from the crush of circumstances, or better put, I threw them out, for the crush wasn\u2019t from outside me but in my own assumptions.\u201d\u2014Marcus Aurelius, Meditations, 9.13\nOn tough days we might say, \u201cMy work is overwhelming,\u201d or \u201cMy boss is really frustrating.\u201d If only we could understand that this is impossible. Someone can\u2019t frustrate you, work can\u2019t overwhelm you-these are external objects, and they have no access to your mind. Those emotions you feel, as real as they are, come from the inside, not the outside.\nThe Stoics use the word hypole\u0302psis, which means \u201ctaking up\u201d\u2014of perceptions, thoughts, and judgments by our mind. What we assume, what we willingly generate in our mind, that\u2019s on us. We can\u2019t blame other people for making us feel stressed or frustrated any more than we can blame them for our jealousy. The cause is within us. They\u2019re just the target.\nA PROPER FRAME OF MIND\n\u201cFrame your thoughts like this\u2014you are an old person, you won\u2019t let yourself be enslaved by this any longer, no longer pulled like a puppet by every impulse, and you\u2019ll stop complaining about your present fortune or dreading the future.\u201d \u2014Marcus Aurelius, Meditations, 2.2\nWe resent the person who comes in and tries to boss us around. Don\u2019t tell me how to dress, how to think, how to do my job, how to live. This is because we are independent, self-sufficient people.\nOr at least that\u2019s what we tell ourselves.\nYet if someone says something we disagree with, something inside us tells us we have to argue with them. If there\u2019s a plate of cookies in front of us, we have to eat them. If someone does something we dislike, we have to get mad about it. When something bad happens, we have to be sad, depressed, or worried. But if something good happens a few minutes later, all of a sudden we\u2019re happy, excited, and want more.\nWe would never let another person jerk us around the way we let our impulses do. It\u2019s time we start seeing it that way\u2014that we\u2019re not puppets that can be made to dance this way or that way just because we feel like it. We should be the ones in control, not our emotions, because we are independent, self-sufficient people.\nKEEP IT SIMPLE\n\u201cAt every moment keep a sturdy mind on the task at hand, as a Roman and human being, doing it with strict and simple dignity, affection, freedom, and justice\u2014giving yourself a break from all other considerations. You can do this if you approach each task as if it is your last, giving up every distraction, emotional subversion of reason, and all drama, vanity, and complaint over your fair share. You can see how mastery over a few things makes it possible to live an abundant and devout life\u2014for, if you keep watch over these things, the gods won\u2019t ask for more.\u201d \u2014 Marcus Aurelius, Meditations, 2.5\nEach day presents the chance to overthink things. What should I wear? Do they like me? Am I eating well enough? What\u2019s next for me in life? Is my boss happy with my work?\nToday, let\u2019s focus just on what\u2019s in front of us. We\u2019ll follow the dictum that New England Patriots coach Bill Belichick gives his players: \u201cDo your job.\u201d Like a Roman, like a good soldier, like a master of our craft. We don\u2019t need to get lost in a thousand other distractions or in other people\u2019s business.\nMarcus says to approach each task as if it were your last, because it very well could be. And even if it isn\u2019t, botching what\u2019s right in front of you doesn\u2019t help anything. Find clarity in the simplicity of doing.\nNEVER DO ANYTHING OUT OF HABIT\n\u201cSo in the majority of other things, we address circumstances not in accordance with the right assumptions, but mostly by following wretched habit. Since all that I\u2019ve said is the case, the person in training must seek to rise above, so as to stop seeking out pleasure and steering away from pain; to stop clinging to living and abhorring death; and in the case of property and money, to stop valuing receiving over giving.\u201d\u2014Musonius Rufus, Lectures, 6.25.5\u201311                                   \nA worker is asked: \u201cWhy did you do it this way?\u201d The answer, \u201cBecause that\u2019s the way we\u2019ve always done things.\u201d The answer frustrates every good boss and sets the mouth of every entrepreneur watering. The worker has stopped thinking and is mindlessly operating out of habit. The business is ripe for disruption by a competitor, and the worker will probably get fired by any thinking boss.\nWe should apply the same ruthlessness to our own habits. In fact, we are studying philosophy precisely to break ourselves of rote behavior. Find what you do out of rote memory or routine. Ask yourself: Is this really the best way to do it? Know why you do what you do\u2014do it for the right reasons.                                                            \nYOUR CAREER IS NOT A LIFE SENTENCE\n\u201cHow disgraceful is the lawyer whose dying breath passes while at court, at an advanced age, pleading for unknown litigants and still seeking the approval of ignorant spectators.\u201d\u2014Seneca, On the Brevity of Life, 20.2\nEvery few years, a sad spectacle is played out in the news. An old millionaire, still lord of his business empire, is taken to court. Shareholders and family members go to court to argue that he is no longer mentally competent to make decisions\u2014that the patriarch is not fit to run his own company and legal affairs. Because this powerful person refused to ever relinquish control or develop a succession plan, he is subjected to one of life\u2019s worst humiliations: the public exposure of his most private vulnerabilities.\nWe must not get so wrapped up in our work that we think we\u2019re immune from the reality of aging and life. Who wants to be the person who can never let go? Is there so little meaning in your life that your only pursuit is work until you\u2019re eventually carted off in a coffin?\nTake pride in your work. But it is not all.                                                            \nPROTECT YOUR PEACE OF MIND\n\u201cKeep constant guard over your perceptions, for it is no small thing you are protecting, but your respect, trustworthiness and steadi- ness, peace of mind, freedom from pain and fear, in a word your freedom. For what would you sell these things?\u201d\u2014Epictetus, Discourses, 4.3.6b\u20138\nThe dysfunctional job that stresses you out, a contentious relationship, life in the spotlight. Stoicism, because it helps us manage and think through our emotional reactions, can make these kinds of situations easier to bear. It can help you manage and mitigate the triggers that seem to be so constantly tripped.\nBut here\u2019s a question: Why are you subjecting yourself to this? Is this really the environment you were made for? To be provoked by nasty emails and an endless parade of workplace problems? Our adrenal glands can handle only so much before they become exhausted. Shouldn\u2019t you preserve them for life-and-death situations?\nSo yes, use Stoicism to manage these difficulties. But don\u2019t forget to ask: Is this really the life I want? Every time you get upset, a little bit of life leaves the body. Are these really the things on which you want to spend that priceless resource? Don\u2019t be afraid to make a change\u2014a big one.\nRyan Holiday is the bestselling author of The Obstacle Is the Wayand Ego is the Enemy, whose forthcoming book, The Daily Stoic: 366 Meditations on Wisdom, Perseverance, and the Art of Living, will be released on October 18.

Editorial decided it would no longer accept columns of this nature on this topic. I have the utmost respect for the leadership at the Observer, but I respectfully disagree with that decision. Anyone who would like to republish the article is welcome to.\nDad, let me start this letter by saying that it isn\u2019t my intention to embarrass you. I find that I can express myself in writing better than I can when we talk on the phone (in fact, if anyone likes this piece, that will be, in its own way, a compliment to you\u2014I developed as a writer sitting alone in my room as a kid, trying to find ways to respond to your overwhelming parental logic) and so when I heard that you were leaning towards voting for Donald Trump, I felt inclined to put my thoughts down so they would be clear.\nIt's fitting that I would write to you here anyway, because the Observer has its own father issues when it comes to Donald Trump (Mr. Trump is the publisher\u2019s father-in-law.) This is a newspaper that, despite its sincere and passionate reporting on anti-Semitism and its frontline investigations on the rise of Russia as a national security threat, has found itself endorsing and defending Trump...even as he veers dangerously towards courting anti-Semitism and justifying Russia\u2019s authoritarian methods (when he isn\u2019t complimenting the tactics of Saddam Hussein.) Having been associated with my own fair share of controversial people, I empathize with the position, Jared Kushner, the paper\u2019s owner, must be in.\nI get that elections are complicated. Yet I cannot help but feel that the right choice has become increasingly simple. Not easy, but simple.\nThe choice is simple because it\u2019s hard for me to think of a single person who violates more of what you taught me as a child. The case against Donald Trump as a candidate\u2014even as a person worthy of two seconds of anyone\u2019s serious attention in our busy lives\u2014is clear to me precisely because of what I learned from you, Dad.\nI remember the trips we took to Angel Island in the San Francisco Bay. This is where people like Grandma and Grandpa first arrived in America, you told us. It was here that they stopped on their way to the American Dream, fleeing the terror of their homeland and hoping for a better life. You taught us that it was honorable and brave to be an immigrant and that what made America special was that we opened our arms to these people. Do you remember taking us to the Civil War battlefields and explaining how many of the men who fought and died in that war were fresh off the boat, paying for their citizenship to this country in blood\u2014dying to eradicate the scourge of slavery, a plague they had nothing to do with creating in the first place? That was what made America great, you said.\nBut you didn\u2019t just teach us to admire white European immigrants either. It was from you that I learned to respect just how hard Latino, Asian, and Middle Eastern immigrants worked to make a life for themselves here. You told me what it was like picking fruit in the California heat, and explained how they took jobs that other people weren\u2019t willing to do\u2014because they wanted to support their families just like everyone else. You also took the time to explain how many immigrants were entrepreneurs\u2014starting restaurants and small businesses from donut shops to car dealerships (we\u2019ve invested together in a few of those small businesses) and how their efforts made the world better for everyone.\nWhen I was in Austria a few years ago, I called Mom and had her do some research to find the location of the refugee camp that Grandpa was sent to when he was just a little younger than I am now. It\u2019s an apartment complex now, which I guess goes to show how quickly we can forget the kind of thinking that creates such horrors. Experiences like these\u2014they color the way I see the world, which is why, I imagine, you encouraged us to travel and study history. Those trips are why I find it so repulsive to hear Donald Trump talk about how Mexicans are \u201crapists\u201d and how his solution is building a literal wall\u2014 \u201cWe\u2019re going to have a big, beautiful wall that nobody\u2019s crossing\u201d\u2014to keep these kinds of people out. I find it disgusting to hear him talk about banning Muslims from America. That\u2019s not what you taught me. That\u2019s not how this country is supposed to work. Mom and half our relatives wouldn\u2019t be here if it was.\nI told you that a few weeks ago we had someone out at the house to repair some damage from the floods. As I was walking the property with the guy, he asked me if I owned a gun. I said that I did\u2014this is Texas after all. \u201cGood,\u201d he said, \u201cyou\u2019ll need to have something when them sand niggers come and try to take this country from us.\u201d Then he told me about how he was glad Donald Trump was speaking the truth and taking things in the right direction.\nI know you don\u2019t agree with this man. And I don\u2019t think it\u2019s fair to hold a candidate accountable for every fringe group that attaches themselves to their platform. But doesn\u2019t it alarm you to see a candidate who seems to stoke these kinds of fires\u2014directly or indirectly? Surely you must be shaking your head at Trump\u2019s repeated refusal to distance himself from these people.\nAs a police officer, you worked for a time in the hate crimes division. You\u2019ve seen the horrible things that prejudice and ignorance can do. I remember you once told me that the way the Ku Klux Klan recruited people in our hometown was by convincing white people that they were being attacked and that their way of life was under siege. C\u2019mon Dad, is that not eerily similar to some of Trump\u2019s campaign tactics? Why else would he have refused to immediately disavow the support of David Duke and other white supremacists? What possible purpose did he have to insinuate that President Obama was a Muslim, that he was not born in America? Or question a Mexican-American judge\u2019s loyalty to the law and to the Constitution?\nA few years ago, Donald Trump went on live television and talked about nice his daughter Ivanka\u2019s body was, saying how if he wasn\u2019t her father, he\u2019d probably be dating her. It was disturbing then, but we all say things that come off utterly differently than intended. Except last year, speaking to a Rolling Stone reporter, Trump said the exact same thing again. \u201cYeah, she's really something, and what a beauty, that one,\u201d he told the journalist. \u201cIf I weren't happily married and, ya know, her father...\u201d\nYou have a daughter (and now a daughter-in-law). Can you imagine saying anything like that about them? What would you say to one of your friends who uttered something half that creepy? You\u2019ve been married for thirty years. You taught me about respecting women, about the importance of marriage and fidelity. This man, he doesn\u2019t stand for any of that. On the contrary, he refers to women he doesn\u2019t like as \u201cfat pigs\u201d and \u201cdogs.\u201d He attacks them and when they press him on the issues, says it\u2019s because they\u2019re probably menstruating.\nYou\u2019ve protected presidents and other heads of state as part of your job. Can you imagine any of them behaving that way? I remember our family trip to the White House in middle school\u2014even though you disagreed with the man who was President, you spoke of the office with such reverence and dignity that we felt honored just to visit. I left that day with exactly the sense of admiration and respect for the office that I think you hoped we\u2019d feel. I remember another trip to New York where we walked by the Trump Tower. What\u2019s that, I asked? You just shook your head and said, \u201cTacky.\u201d\nBefore he died, Grandad gave me his copy of John McCain\u2019s memoir Faith of My Fathers and said that I might like to read it. It wasn\u2019t until years later that I got around to it. Did you know that when John McCain was trapped in that horrible North Vietnamese prison, his captors offered to let him go several times? McCain\u2019s father was the commander of all US forces in the Vietnam theater and the Vietcong thought by giving his son an easy way out, they could show that Americans were cowards. Despite the repeated torture that he\u2019d already undergone, despite the fact that McCain ached to go home, he refused. He stayed because he refused to embarrass his country or abandon his comrades\u2014death was better than dishonor. I think that\u2019s the kind of lesson that Grandad was trying to pass along to me. I know you voted for McCain in 2000 and in 2008 in part for that very reason. I don\u2019t agree with many of McCain\u2019s politics but I hope that when tested, I could exhibit one iota of the courage that that man has.\nAnd yet here we are discussing a Republican candidate who insulted John McCain in front of the entire world\u2014claiming that John McCain isn\u2019t a hero because he was captured and spent time in a POW camp. Donald Trump, who got out of serving with a series of draft deferments, said he only likes the veterans \u201cthat weren\u2019t captured.\u201d That this pathetic encounter has been nearly forgotten in the campaign is not because Donald addressed it or apologized, but rather because nearly every day since he either said something worse or piled on with some other obscene gesture or gaffe.\nWouldn\u2019t just a single one of these remarks have run a candidate out of the race in a normal election cycle? Wouldn\u2019t have these repeated and ridiculous lapses in judgement effectively end the campaign for anyone in any election anywhere in the civilized world? I\u2019ve tried to think about why we\u2019ve been so forgiving of Donald Trump. Is it because his opponent is a woman? Does it say something about us? Have we all collectively lost our sense of where the line is and we\u2019re just hoping that someone will finally draw it for us?\nI realize that most of these issues I\u2019ve brought up are personal ones, but isn\u2019t all politics personal? That\u2019s a lesson I learned from you, too. I remember asking whether you supported the Republican or the Democrat candidate in some local election when I was a kid, having heard some friends\u2019 parents talking about it. You told me that people got too caught up in party affiliation and that what really mattered was character and whether you could work together with the person (and whether they could do the job). That\u2019s how I\u2019ve tried to think all my life. I\u2019m thinking about it now that it really matters.\nThe baffling reality is that when it comes to Trump, it\u2019s difficult to critique him on much besides his personality and (lack of) character\u2014because that is all there is. Maybe you can make an exception for some of these comments, I\u2019ve certainly said dumb things before. We all have. Maybe we chalk them up to media mischaracterizations as some of the Trump supporters I know have (given what I write about in this column, I\u2019m the last one to think the media is completely fair or trustworthy). But even making allowances for that, I know for a fact, no matter what the talking heads on TV are trying to tell moderate conservatives, is that you and he stand very far apart on most of the economic principles and civil policies in which you have always believed.\nI remember long trips in the car and the conversation we had about civics and governance. The basics you taught me about the free market, about capitalism, about the government staying out of people\u2019s business. Now that I\u2019m an adult, I\u2019ve come to fully understand and truly appreciate why you taught me these lessons. I see how they\u2019ve contributed to my own success. I also see how the few policies or firm beliefs Trump might actually have fly in the face of all of them.\nBesides repeatedly donating money to Democratic (and Republican) candidates from whom he tried to get favors, Donald Trump has said publicly that there should be \u201csome form of punishment\u201d for women who get abortions (though he later backtracked under pressure). He\u2019s advocated economic policies that the experts say will start trade wars with China and Mexico. He cheered Brexit because it might drive traffic to his Scottish golf courses (the definition of a conflict of interest), has hinted at using federal resources to go after personal enemies like Jeff Bezos, admits he would continue to let his children run his numerous international businesses while in office, supports \u201copening up\u201d our libel laws to reduce freedom of the press, and apparently believes that global warming is a lie created by China.\nI suppose it would be one thing if these beliefs came from some unique ideological framework but we both know they don\u2019t. He\u2019s a man who reacts, a man who speaks before he thinks (something you always taught me to avoid). These aren\u2019t the meticulously crafted positions of an educated leader surrounded by qualified and informed policy experts\u2014as Trump famously said, he advises himself. There is a quote I read from Winston Churchill recently. During World War One, someone asked why he was reading the work of a certain anti-war poet. \u201cI am not a bit afraid of Siegfried Sassoon,\u201d Churchill said, \u201cThat man can think. I am only afraid of people who cannot think.\u201d\nI think that\u2019s why I am so scared, Dad. That\u2019s why I am writing you this letter. I don\u2019t think this man has done a lick of thinking in years\u2014except about himself and the irrational prejudices and fears which rule his increasingly erratic and bizarre life.\nIf my understanding of where you sit it is correct, you are inclined to agree with most of the criticisms I've just made and yet are swayed by very few of them. As is true for a lot of Americans, I know you\u2019ve been disturbed with a lot what Trump has said and wish sincerely that someone else was running in his place. The problem is\u2014the reason you can\u2019t help but feel pressure to give him the benefit of the doubt or vote for him reluctantly\u2014is that you feel a profound and real distrust towards Hillary Clinton.\nI wasn\u2019t old enough to experience the anger and disillusionment that the Clintons brought to the White House. I get the sense that you see them as thoughtless, careless self-aggrandizers who believe themselves to be above the law. Given the evidence, this is a more than fair assessment. You have real, negative experiences with the last administration and the vague memories of the scandals and noise of that era probably makes another four years seem unappealing. I get it.\nIt was J.K. Galbraith who said that politics was a matter of choosing between the disastrous and the unpalatable. I don\u2019t disagree with you we are dealing with less than ideal options. But surely, unpalatable is better than disastrous.\nThen again, no one is saying you have to vote for Hillary. I\u2019m just asking if you could not vote for Donald Trump. Vote for a third party candidate. For a write-in, you could take a page from Trump\u2019s people, who when they initially had trouble finding people to speak on his behalf at the convention, apparently just put \u201cGeorge Washington\u201d in as a placeholder. Or, what about just not voting in this election? Is that not a powerful statement in its own right? One does not need to endorse disaster just because they resent unpalatable.\nMitt Romney has said that he was finally motivated to get involved in this election when his son asked him, \u201cWhen the grandkids ask \u2018What did you do to stop Donald Trump?\u2019 what are you going to say?\u2019\u201d\nI was so happy to be able to tell you a few weeks ago that you have your first grandchild on the way and that he\u2019s expected to arrive just three days before the election. I think that\u2019s why I am writing this letter too, as my way of asking myself what am I going to do to make sure the world he enters is just a little bit better than the one I came into thirty years ago. I guess I am writing this letter to ask that you, as his grandfather, do what you can to ensure the same.\nSo that when he does ask, not that many years in the future, looking back at what was hopefully just a painful aberration in this nation\u2019s history, we both have a good answer to how we faced this challenge in front of us. And that we acted\u2014despite any personal feelings, or complications or doubts\u2014with principle and courage.\nDad, please don\u2019t vote for Donald Trump. Everything you've taught me about what is wrong in the world is everything that man represents. And if you won't do it for me, do it for your grandchild. Give him something to be proud of\u2014and thankful for.\nYour Loving Son,\nRyan\nRyan Holiday is the best-selling author of Ego is the Enemy and three other books.

His name has been so obscured and forgotten by history that he makes an underappreciated general like George Marshall seem positively famous. At least they named the Marshall Plan after George.\nAs Rome\u2019s highest ranking commander under the Byzan\u00adtine emperor Justinian, Belisarius saved Western civilization on at least three occasions. As Rome collapsed and the seat of the empire moved to Constantinople, Belisarius was the only bright light in a dark time for Christianity. Chances are, you haven\u2019t even heard of him.\nAll the same, the man won brilliant victories at Dara, Carthage, Naples, Sic\u00adily, and Constantinople. He saved the emperor\u2019s life when it was threatened by a riotous mob. He reclaimed farflung territories and recaptured Rome for the first time since it fell\u200a\u2014\u200aall before he was 40.\nHis thanks? He was not given public thanks or celebrations. Instead, he was repeatedly second guessed by the emperor and at the end of his illustrious career, Belisarius was stripped of his wealth, and according to the legend, blinded, and forced to beg in the streets to survive.\nHistorians, scholars, and artists have lamented and argued about this treatment for centuries. They\u2019re rightfully outraged at the ungratefulness, and the pettiness this great and unusual man was subjected to. But guess who never complained about it, even when he had the chance? Belisarius.\nIt seems that he was content to simply do his job. That he took pride in doing it well. And that was enough.\nFor Belisarius, this attitude came from a sense of Christian duty which allowed him to put up with the difficulties inherent in his position. Today, while we hope not to be exposed to this kind of preposterously unjust treatment whether at the hands of our bosses, colleagues or government, we nevertheless must understand that thriving in the real world\u200a\u2014\u200aespecially the creative world\u200a\u2014\u200awill require a similar mindset. Not a religious devotion, but a commitment to the work, as opposed to the rewards.\nThough obvious, we often forget that when we work on a project\u200a\u2014\u200awhetherit\u2019s a book or a business or otherwise\u200a\u2014\u200aat a certain point, that thing leaves our hands and enters the realm of the world. It is judged, received, and acted on by other people (whether they are called audiences, bosses, clients, critics, customers or judges). Their response is outside our control.\nIn other words, even if we do everything right, the reaction might be failure, disrespect, jealousy, or even a resounding yawn from the world. If we are motivated by the wrong thing\u200a\u2014\u200aif ego holds sway\u200a\u2014\u200athis response will crush us.\nI\u2019ve seen it happen a hundred times. I\u2019ve done it myself too.\nBelisarius could win his battles. He could lead his men. He could determine his personal ethics. He could not make the Emperor like and appreciate him. He had no ability to control whether a powerful dicta\u00adtor would treat him well.\nThe same is true for our work. How we respond to this dilemma determines who we are as people as well as the quality of what we will create.\nCan we do the right thing even if it\u2019s not recognized? Will we work hard for something that can be taken away from us? Will we lash out and be wronged just because someone else doesn\u2019t play by the rules?\nI released my book two weeks ago. I sold more copies than I ever expected to sell\u200a\u2014\u200athat\u2019s a good thing. Yet I did not appear on the New York TimesBestseller List (despite rightfully earning a place there) or the Wall Street Journal Bestseller List (where my book should have been number one). Why did this happen? I\u2019m not sure.\nI do know that there are certain games it is possible to play with the list and I chose not to play them. I know that I might have done something that pissed the New York Times off a few years ago\u200a\u2014\u200amaybe they\u2019re still mad about it. I also know that my publisher messed some reporting stuff up that might have impacted my chances on one of the lists. (I did hit the nationalUSA Today list and a few other international lists).\nIn any case, I did all the right things. I wrote the book. I hustled my ass off. I didn\u2019t cheat. And the reward?\nI was screwed over and deprived of something that was mine\u200a\u2014\u200athat would be very good for my career.\nExcept that is a preposterously selfish and short sighted way to look at it. First off, because I actually achieved the thing that the list is supposed to recognize (selling well). In fact, I sold more than I expected to sell, reached a lot of people, and got recognized in some places but not others. But those are not things to take pride in. It\u2019s better to find satisfaction in knowing that I wrote the best book that I was capable of writing. Knowing that I pushed myself continually through the process and emerged better for it. Those are two things that were entirely in my control. If my happiness was dependent on everything else going my way, then I would not only be a hypocrite, but a miserable person most of the time.\nI\u2019m not saying that it\u2019s easy to think this way. I\u2019m not saying that I haven\u2019t had to struggle with my anger about it a dozen times since I first found out. But what else am I going to do? Throw a tantrum? Where will that get me?\nWe need to cultivate the humility and discipline necessary to accept that we have only minimal control over the rewards for our work and effort\u200a\u2014\u200aother people\u2019s validation, recognition, rewards.\nThink of all the activists who will find that they can only advance their cause so far. The leaders who are assassinated before their work is done. The inventors whose ideas lan\u00adguish \u201cahead of their time.\u201d According to society\u2019s main metrics, these people were not rewarded for their work. Should they have not done it? Should they not be kind, not work hard, not produce, because there is a chance it wouldn\u2019t be reciprocated? Should they have done the wrong thing instead?\nC\u2019mon.\nYet in our most egotistical and wounded moments\u200a\u2014\u200awhen struggling with our earsplitting \u201cexpectation hangover\u201d\u200a\u2014\u200aevery one of us has considered doing pre\u00adcisely that. Wanted to say: \u201cFuck \u2019em, they don\u2019t appreciate me anyway.\u201d\nIt might feel good in the short term, but it\u2019s awful in the long term.\nIt\u2019s far better (and more resilient) when doing good work is sufficient. When fulfilling our own standards is what fills us with pride and self respect. When the effort\u200a\u2014\u200anot the results, good or bad\u200a\u2014\u200ais enough.\nIt calls to mind the encounter between Alexander the Great and the famous Cynic philosopher Diogenes. Allegedly, Alexander approached Diogenes, who was lying down, enjoying the summer air, and stood over him and asked what he, the most powerful man in the world, might be able to do for this notoriously poor man. Diogenes could have asked for anything. What he requested was epic: \u201cStop blocking my sun.\u201d Even two thousand years later we can feel exactly where in the solar plexus that must have hit Alexander, a man who always wanted to prove how important he was. As the author Robert Louis Stevenson later observed about this meeting, \u201cIt is a sore thing to have labored along and scaled arduous hilltops, and when all is done, find humanity indifferent to your achievement.\u201d\nWe need to try for that as well. Because maybe our parents will never be impressed. Maybe our girlfriend won\u2019t care. Maybe the investor won\u2019t see the numbers. Maybe the audi\u00adence won\u2019t clap. But we have to be able to push through. We can\u2019t let that be what motivates us.\nHow do you carry on then? How do you take pride in yourself and your work? John Wooden\u2019s advice to his players says it: Change the definition of success. \u201cSuccess is peace of mind, which is a direct result of self satisfaction in knowing you made the effort to do your best to become the best that you are capable of becoming.\u201d \u201cAmbition,\u201d Marcus Aurelius reminded himself, \u201cmeans tying your well\u00adbeing to what other people say or do . . . Sanity means tying it to your own actions.\u201d In other words: Do your work. Do it well. Let that be the end of your concern.\nAnd understand, that even so\u200a\u2014\u200athere will be times when you will be unappreciated. You will be sabotaged. You will experience surprising failures. Your expectations will not be met. You will lose. You will fail.\nRecognition and rewards\u200a\u2014\u200athose must be extra. John Kennedy Toole\u2019s great book A Confederacy of Dunces was universally turned down by publishers, news that so broke his heart that he later committed suicide in his car on an empty road in Biloxi, Mississippi. After his death, his mother discovered the book, advocated on its behalf until it was published, and it eventually won the Pulitzer Prize.\nThink about that for a second. What changed between those submissions? Nothing. The book was the same. It was equally great when Toole had it in manuscript form and had fought with editors about it as it was when the book was published, sold copies, and won awards. If only he could have realized this, it would have saved him so much heart\u00adbreak. He couldn\u2019t, but from his painful example we can at least see how arbitrary many of the breaks in life are.\nThis is why we are the only people who should define what success looks like\u200a\u2014\u200aand that that success should not depend on externals. It should be on us.\nThe world is, after all, indifferent to what we humans \u201cwant.\u201d What can go wrong will. If we persist in wanting, in needing that to not happen?\nOnly misery and disappointment awaits.\nBut if we can find joy and satisfaction in the work? Well that can be ours right now.\nRyan Holiday is the bestselling author of Ego is the Enemy and three other books.

They said: \u201cJust make your boss look good.\u201d\nNow in Hollywood, a world of big egos obsessed with getting credit, there is really no other way for someone just starting out to survive. But it turns out that across industries and across history,aspiring young men and women have used this same approach to get ahead.\nThey realized that the best way to advance their own interests was to do something simple but counterintuitive: provide opportunities for other people. Not only because it makes their boss look good, but because it creates its own opportunities for the pupil to learn and explore.\nFor instance, many people know that as a young man Benjamin Franklin published numerous letters written under fake names like Silence Dogwood. What they don\u2019t know is that Franklin wrote those letters, sub\u00admitted them by sliding them under the print\u00adshop door, and received absolutely no credit for them until much later in his life. In fact, it was his brother, the owner, who profited from their immense popularity, regularly running them on the front page of his newspaper. Franklin was playing the long game, though \u2014 learning how public opinion worked, generating awareness of what he believed in, crafting his style and tone and wit. It was a strategy he used time and again over his career \u2014 once even publishing in his compet\u00aditor\u2019s paper in order to undermine a third competitor \u2014 for Franklin saw the constant benefit in making other people look good and letting them take credit for his ideas.\nOne must master their ego to be able to completely ignore getting credit, getting ahead, even throwing out what your job is supposed to be on paper. It takes a special type of humility to focus your energy on finding, presenting, and facilitating opportunities that help other people succeed.\nBut this is essential.\nBill Belichick, the now four-time Super Bowl-winning coach of the New England Patriots, made his way up the ranks of the NFL by loving and mastering how to do the one thing that coaches hated at the time: analyzing film.\nHis first job in professional football for the Baltimore Colts was one he volunteered to take without pay \u2014 and his insights, which provided ammunition and critical strategies for the game, were attributed exclusively to the other public-facing coaches.  \u201cHe was like a sponge, tak\u00ading it all in, listening to everything,\u201d one coach said. \u201cYou gave him an assignment and he disappeared into a room and you didn\u2019t see him again until it was done, and then he wanted to do more,\u201d said another.\nThis gave him two things: first, a role in the organization that allowed him to thrive and carve out space for himself, two, an understanding of the game that today cannot be matched. And today, Beli\u00adchick has no problem getting paid.\nA few years ago there was some controversy because Sheryl Sandberg, the COO of Facebook, was looking for an unpaid intern. How dare she?! bloggers shouted and yelled. She can afford to pay! Of course, she could. But can you afford to pass on that opportunity?\nThe attitude of the angry, unappreciated genius\u2014that gets us nowhere. Nowhere but living back at home with our parents because \u201cwe\u2019re overqualified\u201d for an entry-level position. Nowhere but a reputation for being a person who doesn\u2019t work well with others, who is entitled and obnoxious.\nMeanwhile, the apprenticeship model is responsible for some of the greatest art in the history of the world\u2014everyone from Michelangelo to Leonardo da Vinci to Benjamin Franklin has been forced to navigate such a system. The greatest networkers in the world practice their art by delivering extraordinary amounts of value to everyone they meet.\nIt\u2019s because they realize what most people\u2019s ego\u2019s prevent them from seeing: that by serving and helping others now, you\u2019re really helping yourself.\nI\u2019ve seen this in my own life. For many years, I was a research assistant and apprentice for the author Robert Greene, creator of the 48 Laws of Power. My job was to contribute little bits and pieces to his books that 99% of the public would have no idea I was responsible for. But I loved it. I did it for years.\nWorking in that system, also taught me the fatal consequences of ego. One slip up, one false belief that you were indispensable to the project, and the door would be shut on you. Important people don\u2019t have time for that. But the quieter and more helpful I could be? The more opportunities I had to contribute. The more I learned. The more trust I was given.\nSlowly I developed my own abilities and was able to pursue my own career. I\u2019m writing this article (and now my own books) because of it.\nThere is an old saying, \u201cSay little, do much.\u201d What we really ought to do is update and apply a version of that to our early approach. Be lesser, do more. Imagine if for every person you met, you thought of some way to help them, something you could do for them? And you looked at it in a way that entirely benefited them and not you. The cumu\u00adlative effect this would have over time would be profound: You\u2019d learn a great deal by solving diverse problems. You\u2019d develop a reputation for being indispensable. You\u2019d have countless new relationships. You\u2019d have an enormous bank of favors to call upon down the road.\nThat\u2019s what this strategy is about \u2014 helping yourself by helping others. Making a concerted effort to trade your short\u00ad term gratification for a longer\u00adterm payoff. Whereas everyone else wants to get credit and be \u201crespected,\u201d you can forget credit. You can forget it so hard that you\u2019re glad when others get it instead of you \u2014 that was your aim, after all. Consider it all an investment.\nThis approach is here for you at anytime. There is no expiration date on it either. It\u2019s one of the few that age does not limit \u2014 on either side, young or old. You can start at any time \u2014 before you have a job, before you\u2019re hired and while you\u2019re doing something else, or if you\u2019re starting something new or find yourself inside an organization with\u00adout strong allies or support. You may even find that there\u2019s no reason to ever stop doing it, even once you\u2019ve graduated to heading your own projects. Let it become natural and permanent \u2014 always, always find opportunities for other people.\nThis piece is adapted from the book Ego is the Enemy, published by Penguin/Portfolio.\nRyan Holiday is the bestselling author of Ego Is The Enemy and three other books.

Stuck in a job we don\u2019t like. Stuck across town because a meeting was cancelled. Stuck with an obligation that someone else signed us up for. Stuck in a failing company. \nWe\u2019re stuck\u2014we don\u2019t have a choice about that. But we do have a choice about something else: What will we do with this time? \nIn 1946, Malcolm X was sentenced to 10 years in prison. Even accounting for the shameful American racism and whatever systematic legal injustices existed at the time, Mal\u00adcolm X was guilty. He deserved to go to jail. And now he had roughly a decade to sit in a cage. \nAs Malcolm X entered that prison he faced that same choice. He faced what Robert Greene\u2014a man who sixty years later would find his wildly popular books banned in many federal prisons\u2014calls an \u201cAlive Time or Dead Time\u201d scenario. How would the seven years he would serve play out? What would Malcolm do with this time?                                \nAccording to Greene, there are two types of time in our lives: dead time, when people are passive and waiting, and alive time, when people are learning and acting and utiliz\u00ading every second. Every moment of failure, every moment or situation that we did not deliberately choose or control, presents this choice: Alive time. Dead time.\nWhich will it be?\nMalcolm chose alive time. He began to learn. He explored religion. He taught himself to be a reader by checking out a pencil and the dictionary from the prison library and not only consumed it from start to finish, but copied it down long\u2010hand from cover to cover. All these words he\u2019d never known existed before were transferred to his brain. \nAs he said later, \u201cFrom then until I left that prison, in every free moment I had, if I was not reading in the library, I was reading in my bunk.\u201d He read history, he read sociol\u00adogy, he read about religion, he read the classics, he read philosophers like Kant and Spinoza. Later, a reporter asked Malcolm, \u201cWhat\u2019s your alma mater?\u201d His one word answer: \u201cBooks.\u201d\nPrison became his college. He transcended confine\u00adment through the pages he absorbed. He reflected that months passed without him even thinking about being detained against his will. He had \u201cnever been so truly free in his life.\u201d \nAnd yet, here we are, stuck in our own way. Maybe you\u2019re sitting in a remedial high school class, maybe you\u2019re watching for the numbers to come in on your newest launch, maybe it\u2019s a trial separation, maybe you\u2019re stuck making smoothies or living at home while you save up money, maybe you\u2019re stuck waiting out a contract or a tour of duty. Maybe this situation is one totally of your own making, or perhaps it\u2019s just bad luck. \nThe ego in all of us wants to complain about how this situation sucks. How it\u2019s unfair. How we\u2019d rather be doing just about anything else. And it\u2019s this attitude that creates dead time we can never get back. In this way, ego is the mortal enemy of alive time. \nBut if we\u2019re humble, accepting and creative, we can transform seemingly terrible situations\u2014a prison sentence, a dysfunctional job, a bear market or depression, military conscription, a failing company\u2014 turned those circumstances into fuel for greatness.   \nWe can ask ourselves: What can I accomplish here? What can I do with this time? Think of what you have been putting off. Issues you declined to deal with. Systemic problems that felt too over\u00adwhelming to address. Dead time is revived when we use it as an opportunity to do what we\u2019ve long needed to do\u2014from having difficult conversations to squeezing in some quiet reading time. \nFrancis Scott Key wrote the poem that became the national anthem of the United States while trapped on a ship during a prisoner exchange in the War of 1812. Viktor Frankl refined his psychologies of meaning and suffering during his ordeal in three Nazi concentration camps. Not that these opportunities always come in such serious situa\u00adtions. The author Ian Fleming was on bed rest and, per doc\u00adtors\u2019 orders, forbidden from using a typewriter. They were worried he\u2019d exert himself by writing another Bond novel. So he created Chitty-Chitty-Bang-Bang: The Magical Car by hand instead. Walt Disney made his decision to become a cartoonist while laid up after stepping on a rusty nail. \n\u201cMany a serious thinker has been produced in prisons,\u201d as Robert Greene put it, \u201cwhere we have nothing to do but think.\u201d Well, at the very least, our situation can be used for that. To get some serious thinking done.\nIt\u2019s easy to angry, to be aggrieved, to be depressed or heartbroken. I don\u2019t want this. I want ______. I want it my way. But this accomplishes nothing!\nAs they say, this moment is not your life. But it is a moment in your life. How will you use it? \nLet us say, the next time we find ourselves stuck: This is an opportunity for me. I am using it for my purposes. I will not let this be dead time for me. The dead time was when we were controlled by ego. \nAs Booker T. Washington most famously put it, \u201cCast down your bucket where you are.\u201d Make use of what\u2019s around you. Even the dead time. Because while its occurrence isn\u2019t in our control. Its use, on the other hand, is. \nThis piece is adapted from Ryan Holiday\u2019s book Ego is the Enemy, published by Penguin Portfolio                                                           \nRyan Holiday is the bestselling author of Ego Is The Enemy and three other books.

He didn\u2019t focus on the buzzer beater. Or the strategy. He said his team won because \u201cthey followed the process.\u201d\nTony Wroten, a guard for the 76ers, got the same advice from his coaches. \u201cThey tell us every game, every day, \u2018trust the process.\u2019\u201d John Fox, the coach trying to turn around the Chicago Bears, asked his team the same thing.\nBut what the hell is it? What is the process?\nIt can be traced to Nick Saban, the famous coach of LSU and Alabama\u2014perhaps the most dominant dynasty in the history of college football. But he got it from a psychiatry professor named Lionel Rosen during his time at Michigan State.\nRosen\u2019s big insight was this: sports\u2014especially football\u2014are complex. Nobody has enough brainpower or motivation to consistently manage all the variables going on in the course of a season, let alone a game. They think they do\u2014but realistically, they don\u2019t.\nThere are too many plays, too many players, too many statistics, countermoves, unpredictables, distractions. Over the course of a long playoff season, this adds up into a cognitively impossible load. Meanwhile, as Monte Burke writes in his book Saban, Rosen discovered that the average play in football lasts just seven seconds. Seven seconds\u2014that\u2019s very manageable.\n  Nick Saban, head coach of the Alabama Crimson Tide (Photo by Rodger Mallison/Fort Worth Star-Telegram/TNS via Getty Images)\nSo he posed a question: What if a team concentrated only on what they could manage? What if they took things step by step\u2014not focusing on anything but what was right in front of them and on doing it well?\nAs a result, Nick Saban doesn\u2019t focus on what every other coach focuses on, or at least not the way they do. He tells them:\n\u201cDon\u2019t think about winning the SEC Championship. Don\u2019t think about the national championship. Think about what you needed to do in this drill, on this play, in this moment. That\u2019s the process: Let\u2019s think about what we can do today, the task at hand.\u201d\nIt\u2019s this message that\u2019s been internalized by his players and his teams\u2014which together have four national championships in an eight-year span, one Mid-American Conference championship, have been crowned SEC champions 15 times and Saban has received multiple coaching awards.\nIn the chaos of sport, as in life, process provides a way. A way to turn something very complex into something simple. Not that simple is easy.\nBut it is easier. Let\u2019s say you\u2019ve got to do something difficult. Don\u2019t focus on that. Instead break it down into pieces. Simply do what you need to do right now. And do it well. And then move on to the next thing. Follow the process and not the prize. As Bill Belichick famously put it, just do your job.\nThe road to back-to-back championships, or being a writer or a successful entrepreneur is just that, a road. And you travel along a road in steps. Excellence is a matter of steps. Excelling at this one, then that one and then the one after that. Saban\u2019s process is exclusively this\u2014existing in the present, taking it one step at a time, not getting distracted by anything else. Not the other team, not the scoreboard, or the crowd.\nThe process is about finishing. Finishing games. Finishing workouts. Finishing film sessions. Finishing drives. Finishing reps. Finishing plays. Finishing blocks. Finishing the smallest task you have right in front of you and finishing it well.\nWhether it\u2019s pursuing the pinnacle of success in your field, or simply surviving some awful or trying ordeal, the same approach works. Don\u2019t think about the end\u2014think about surviving. Getting it right from meal to meal, meeting to meeting, project to project, paycheck to paycheck, one day at a time.\nAnd when you really get it right, even the hardest things become manageable. As Heraclitus observed, \u201cunder the comb, the tangle and the straight path are the same.\u201d That\u2019s what the process is. Under its influence, we needn\u2019t panic. Even mammoth tasks become just a series of component parts.\nThis was what the great 19th-century pioneer of meteorology, James Pollard Espy, had shown to him in a chance encounter as a young man. Unable to read and write until he was 18, Espy attended a rousing speech by the famous orator Henry Clay. After the talk, a spellbound Espy tried to make his way toward Clay, but he couldn\u2019t form the words to speak to his idol. One of his friends shouted out for him: \u201cHe wants to be like you, even though he can\u2019t read.\u201d\nClay grabbed one of his posters, which had the word CLAY written in big letters. He looked at Espy and said, \u201cYou see that, boy?\u201d pointing to a letter. \u201cThat\u2019s an A. Now, you\u2019ve only got 25 more letters to go.\u201d\nEspy had just been gifted The Process. Within a year, he started college.\nWhat Rosen, what Espy, what these coaches are practicing is a central tenet of stoic philosophy\u2014one which I\u2019ve tried to pass along in The Obstacle is The Way. It\u2019s just a modern take on Marcus Aurelius when he advised:\n\u201cDon\u2019t let your imagination be crushed by life as a whole. Don\u2019t try to picture everything bad that could possibly happen. Stick with the situation at hand, and ask, \u201cWhy is this so unbearable? Why can\u2019t I endure it?\u201d\nStatue of the Roman emperor Marcus Aurelius (Photo: Getty Images)\nSeven seconds. Sticking to the situation at hand. Focusing on what\u2019s immediately in front of you. No strain, no struggling. So relaxed. No exertion or worry. Just one simple movement after another. That\u2019s the power of process.\nWe can channel this, too. We needn\u2019t scramble like we\u2019re so often inclined to do when some difficult task sits in front of us. Instead, we can take a breath, do the immediate, composite part in front of us\u2014and follow its thread into the next action. Everything in order, everything connected.\nWhen it comes to our actions, disorder and distraction are death. The unordered mind loses track of what\u2019s in front of it\u2014what matters\u2014and gets distracted by thoughts of the future. The process is order, it keeps our perceptions in check and our actions in sync.\nIt seems obvious, but we forget this when it matters most.\nRight now, if I knocked you down and pinned you to ground, how would you respond? You\u2019d probably panic. And then you\u2019d push with all your strength to get me off you. It wouldn\u2019t work; just using my body weight, I would be able to keep your shoulders against the ground with little effort\u2014and you\u2019d grow exhausted fighting it.\nThat\u2019s the opposite of the process.\nThe process is much easier. First, you don\u2019t panic, you conserve your energy. You don\u2019t do anything stupid like get yourself choked out by acting without thinking. You focus on not letting it get worse. Then you get your arms up, to brace and create some breathing room, some space. Now work to get on your side.  From there you can start to break down my hold on you: grab an arm, trap a leg, buck with your hips, slide in a knee.\nIt\u2019ll take some time, but you\u2019ll get yourself out. At each step, the person on top is forced to give a little up, until there\u2019s nothing left. Then you\u2019re free.\nBeing trapped is just a position, not a fate. You get out of it by addressing and eliminating each part of that position through small, deliberate action\u2014not by trying (and failing) to push it away with superhuman strength.\nWith our business rivals, we rack our brains to think of some mind-blowing new product that will make them irrelevant, and, in the process, we take our eye off the ball. We shy away from writing a book or making a film even though it\u2019s our dream because it\u2019s so much work\u2014we can\u2019t imagine how we get from here to there.\nHow often do we compromise or settle because we feel that the real solution is too ambitious or outside our grasp? How often do we assume that change is impossible because it\u2019s too big? Involves too many different groups? Or worse, how many people are paralyzed by all their ideas and inspirations? They chase them all and go nowhere, distracting themselves and never making headway. They\u2019re brilliant, sure, but they rarely execute. They rarely get where they want and need to go.\nAll these issues are solvable. Each would collapse beneath the process. We\u2019ve just wrongly assumed that it has to happen all at once, and we give up at the thought of it. We are A-to-Z thinkers, fretting about A, obsessing over Z, yet forgetting all about B through Y.\nWe want to have goals, yes, so everything we do can be in service of something purposeful. When we know what we\u2019re really setting out to do, the obstacles that arise tend to seem smaller, more manageable. When we don\u2019t, each one looms larger and seems impossible. Goals help put the blips and bumps in proper proportion.\nWhen we get distracted, when we start caring about something other than our own progress and efforts, the process is the helpful, if occasionally bossy, voice in our head. It is the bark of the wise, older leader who knows exactly who he is and what he\u2019s got to do. Shut up. Go back to your stations and try to think about what we are going to do ourselves, instead of worrying about what\u2019s going on out there. You know what your job is, stop jawing and get to work.\nThe process is the voice that demands we take responsibility and ownership. That prompts us to act even if only in a small way.\nLike a relentless machine, subjugating resistance each and every way it exists, little by little. Moving forward, one step at a time. Subordinate strength to the process. Replace fear with the process. Depend on it. Lean on it. Trust in it.\nTake your time, don\u2019t rush. Some problems are harder than others. Deal with the ones right in front of you first. Come back to the others later. You\u2019ll get there.\nThe process is about doing the right things, right now. Not worrying about what might happen later, or the results, or the whole picture.\nRyan Holiday is the best-selling author of The Obstacle Is the Way: The Timeless Art of Turning Trials into Triumph and two other books."}, {"author": "Ryan Holiday", "headline": "The Single Worst Marketing Decision You Can Make", "body": "Make something people want.\n\u2014Paul Graham\nYou know what the single worst marketing decision you can make is? Starting with a product nobody wants or nobody needs.\nYet for years, this was a scenario that marketers tolerated and accepted as part of the job. We all told ourselves that \u201cyou go to market with the product you have, not the one you want.\u201d And then we wondered why our strategies failed\u2014and why those failures were so expensive.\nWhat attracted me to growth hacking from the very start was that it rejects this obviously flawed approach outright. Growth hackers believe that products\u2014even whole businesses and business models\u2014can and should be changed until they are primed to generat explosive reactions from the first people who see them. In other words, the best marketing decision you can make is to have a product or business that fulfills a real and compelling need for a real and defined group of people\u2014no matter how much tweaking and refining this takes.\nTake Airbnb, a start-up now valued at some $10 billion. Today we know it as a site where, as cofounder Brian Chesky put it, \u201cyou can book space anywhere. It can be anything, and it really is anything from a tent to a castle.\u201d But in 2007, the business started as a way for the founders to turn the living room of their loft apartment into a little bed-and-breakfast. The founders named it airbedandbreakfast.com and put out air mattresses on their floor and offered free homemade breakfast to guests. But the founders wanted more.\nGoing back to the drawing board and hoping to capitalize on popular technology and design conferences, the founders repositioned the service as a networking alternative for attendees when hotels were booked up. This was clearly a better market, but the company sensed they could improve the idea further, so they pivoted slightly to target the type of traveler who didn\u2019t want to crash on couches or in hostels but was looking to avoid hotels. This did better still. Finally, based on feedback and usage patterns, they shortened the name to airbnb and abandoned the breakfast and networking parts of the business, redefining the service as a place for people to rent or book any kind of lodging imaginable (from rooms to apartments to trains, boats, castles, penthouses, and private islands). This was explosive\u2014to the tune of millions of bookings a year in locations all over the world.\nAirbnb had a good idea in 2007, but the actual value proposition, if we\u2019re being honest, was a little mediocre. The founders could have spent all their time and energy trying to force the \u201clet people crash on your floor and feed them breakfast\u201d angle and creating a small business around it. Instead, they treated their product and service as something malleable and were able to change and improve it until they found its best iteration. They went from a good but fairly impractical idea to an explosive and practical idea, and then as a result, a billion-dollar valuation. This switch was undoubtedly the best marketing decision they ever could have made.\nAs a traditional marketer, I can think of precisely zero times when we went back to the drawing board after seeing a less-than-stellar response. It wasn\u2019t permitted. Our only move was to put more muscle behind bad products and companies.\nIt was a wake-up call to me to learn that Airbnb was by no means unique: Instagram started as a location-based social network called Burbn (which had an optional photo feature). It attracted a core group of users and more than $500,000 in funding. And yet the founders realized that its users were flocking to only one part of the app\u2014the photos and filters. They had a meeting, which one of the founders recounts like this: \u201cWe sat down and said, \u2018What are we going to work on next? How are we going to evolve this product into something millions of people will want to use? What is the one thing that makes this product unique and interesting?\u2019\"\nThe service soon retooled to become Instagram as we know it: a mobile app for posting photos with filters. The result? One hundred thousand users within a week of relaunching. Within eighteen months, the founders sold Instagram to Facebook for $1 billion.\nI know that seems simple, that the marketing lesson from Instragram is that they made a product that was just awesome. But that\u2019s good news for you\u2014it means there\u2019s no secret sauce, and the second your product gets to be that awesome, you can see similar results. Just look at Snapchat, which essentially followed the same playbook by innovating in the mobile photo app space, blew up with young people, and skyrocketed to a $3.5-billion-dollar valuation with next-to-no marketing.\nSome companies like Airbnb and Instragram spend a long time trying new iterations until they achieve what growth hackers call Product Market Fit (PMF); others find it right away. The end goal is the same, however, and it\u2019s to have the product and its customers in perfect sync with each other. Eric Ries, author of The Lean Startup, explains that the best way to get to Product Market Fit is by starting with a \u201cminimum viable product\u201d and improving it based on feedback\u2014as opposed to what most of us do, which is to try to launch publicly with what we think is our final, perfected product.\nToday, it is the marketer\u2019s job as much as anyone else\u2019s to make sure Product Market Fit happens. Your marketing efforts are wasted on a mediocre product\u2014so don\u2019t tolerate mediocrity. OK?\nBut rather than waiting for it to happen magically or assuming that this is some other department\u2019s job, marketers need to contribute to this process. Isolating who your customers are, figuring out their needs, designing a product that will blow their minds\u2014these are marketing decisions, not just development and design choices.\nThe imperative is clear: stop sitting on your hands and start getting them dirty. Optimizing a product to spread and be well received by customers, by the media, and by influencers is something that you, as a marketer or a growth hacker, are uniquely qualified to do. You are, in effect, the translator who helps bridge the producers and the consumers so they are in alignment.\nAnd this is true whether you\u2019re making some physical gadget, designing a menu, or creating an app. Someone has to be the advocate for the potential market (customers), and the earlier their influence is felt in the process, the better.\nAmazon has actually made this part of their basic procedures. Ian McAllister, general manager at Amazon, calls this approach \u201cworking backwards from the customer.\u201d For new initiatives, employees begin by creating an internal press release that announces this new potential project as though it was just finished. It\u2019s addressed to the customers\u2014whoever they happen to be\u2014and explains how this new offering solves their problems in an exciting or compelling way.\nIf the press release cannot do that, the initiative is tweaked and tweaked and tweaked until it can, according to McAllister, Amazon encourages product managers to think like Oprah\u2014that is, would she rapturously shout about this product if she were giving it away to her fans as a gift?\nThe exercise forces the team to focus on exactly what its potential new product is and what\u2019s special about it. I guarantee that someone with a mind that bends toward growth hacking put this policy into place.\nNo longer content to let the development happen as it happens, we can influence it with input, with rules and guidelines, and with feedback. The growth hacker helps with iterations, advises, and analyzes every facet of the business. In other words, Product Market Fit is a feeling backed with data and information.\nHow Do You Get PMF?\nBecause Product Market Fit can be overwhelming as a technical business concept, allow me to explain it by dropping the jargon and presenting an analogy. As it turns out, I was familiar with PMF long before I read Andrew Chen\u2019s article.\nMuch of the marketing I do is with authors and books. I\u2019ve worked with dozens of bestsellers in the last five years\u2014and, of course, I\u2019ve also worked on many books that weren\u2019t successful. In my experience, the books that tend to flop upon release are those where the author goes into a cave for a year to write it, then hands it off to the publisher for release. They hope for a hit that rarely comes.\nOn the other hand, I have clients who blog extensively before publishing. They develop their book ideas based on the themes that they naturally gravitate toward but that also get the greatest response from readers. (One client sold a book proposal using a screenshot of Google queries to his site.) They test the ideas they\u2019re writing about in the book on their blog and when they speak in front of groups. They ask readers what they\u2019d like to see in the book. They judge topic ideas by how many comments a given post generates, by how many Facebook \u201cshares\u201d an article gets. They put potential title and cover ideas up online to test and receive feedback. They look to see what hot topics other influential bloggers are riding and find ways of addressing them in their book.*\nThe latter achieves PMF; the former never does. One is growth hacking; the other, simply guessing.\nOne is easy for me to market. The other is often a lost cause. One needs only a small shove to get going. The other has a strong headwind every step of the way.\nAmazon, for its part, has a couple of other easy suggestions for you if the advice \u201cwrite a hypothetical press release\u201d doesn\u2019t quite work for your situation. Their CTO, Werner Vogels, suggests trying to write an FAQ for this product you\u2019re developing. (That way you can address, in advance, potential user issues and questions.) Or try to define the crucial parts of the user experience by making mockups of pages, writing hypothetical case studies so you can actually start to see what it would look like and who it would work for and how. Finally, try writing the user manual, which as Werner explains usually has three parts: concepts, how-to, and reference. (Defining these means you understand your idea in and out from the customers perspective. Also, he says, if you have more than one type of user then write multiple manuals.)\nI love those ideas. They might feel like homework, but they force you to imagine your product from someone\u2019s perspective other than your own. That\u2019s the best way to get to PMF\u2014because ultimately this isn\u2019t about you; it\u2019s about the people you\u2019re trying to turn into customers.\nPerhaps you\u2019ll get to PMF with one aha moment like Instagram, or it may be incremental percent improvements. As Marc Andreessen\u2014the entrepreneur behind Netscape, Opsware, and Ning who, in addition to running a major venture capital fund, happens to be on the board of directors for Facebook, eBay, and HP\u2014explains it, companies need to \u201cdo whatever is required to get to product/market fit. Including changing out people, rewriting your product, moving into a different market, telling customers no when you don\u2019t want to, telling customers yes when you don\u2019t want to, raising that fourth round of highly dilutive venture capital\u2014whatever is required.\u201d\nIn other words: everything is now on the table.\nOpen Up to Feedback\nPart of this new approach is having the humility to accept that marketers are not necessarily the most critical members of the team. It\u2019s true. Sometimes the best thing marketers can do is to not let people get distracted by \u201cmarketing\u201d for a minute. Sometimes the outward-facing part of the job is exactly the least important part.\nTake Evernote, a start-up that offers productivity and organization software, which made the companywide decision to delay spending even a penny on marketing for the first several years of its growth. As Evernote\u2019s founder, Phil libin, told a group of entrepreneurs in a now-classic talk, \u201cPeople [who are] thinking about things other than making the best product, never make the best product.\u201d So Evernote took \u201cmarketing\u201d off the table and instead poured that budget into product development. This undoubtedly slowed brand building at first\u2014but it paid off. Why? Because Evernote is far and away the most superior productivity and note-taking application on the planet. Today, it practically markets itself.\nPerhaps this is what you need to do. I know you\u2019re probably reading this book looking for some immediate tips you can put into action\u2014places you can deploy your budget or resources. But let\u2019s think outside the box\u2014 outside the budget\u2014and consider whether improving your product might be the best strategy.\nThat\u2019s not to say you shouldn\u2019t do anything at all. Evernote still came up with a bunch of clever tricks to get people to see its products while marketing was on their strategic back burner. After hearing customers complain that their bosses were suspicious of employees using their laptops in meetings, the Evernote team produced stickers that said, \u201cI\u2019m not being rude. I\u2019m taking notes in Evernote.\u201d Thus, their most loyal customers were turning into billboards that went from meeting to meeting.\nOnce we stop thinking of the products we market as static\u2014that our job as marketers is to simply work with what we\u2019ve got instead of working on and improving what we\u2019ve got\u2014the whole game changes. Now we are not helpless, repeatedly pitching a product to reporters and users that is not resonating. Instead, we use this information to improve the product, with the idea of ultimately refining our idea into something that can in many ways sell itself.\nThe race has changed. The prize and spoils no longer go to the person who makes it to market first. They go to the person who makes it to Product Market Fit first. Because once you get there, your marketing efforts become like a spark applied to a bed of kindling soaked in kerosene. The old way? It\u2019s striking a match...and hoping it starts a fire somewhere.\nThe point is: marketing as we know it is a waste of time without PMF.\nOf course, there are many tools to help get you there. From Google to Optimizely to KISSmetrics, there are great services that allow you to see what your users are actually doing and responding to on your site. This insight will get you closer to a fit than gut instincts ever will.\nBut the most effective method is simply the Socratic method. We must simply and repeatedly question every assumption. Who is this product for? Why would they use it? Why do I use it?\nask your customers questions, too: What is it that brought you to this product? What is holding you back from referring other people to it? What\u2019s missing? What\u2019s golden? Don\u2019t ask random people or your friends\u2014be scientific about it. Use tools like Surveymonkey, Wufoo, Qualaroo, or even Google Docs, which make it very easy to offer surveys to some or all of your customers.\nFor the first time we can ask these questions because we intend to do something about it. No more privately complaining to friends, coworkers, and spouses that we\u2019re stuck with a product nobody wants.\nNot to say that you must use all the data that comes back, but you should have it. The black-box approach is no longer necessary. Change is possible\u2014which means you need to make yourself available and open to it.\nProduct Market Fit is not some mythical status that happens accidentally. Companies work for it; they crawl toward it. They\u2019re ready to throw out weeks or months of\nN work because the evidence supports that decision. The services as their customers know them now are fundamentally different from what they were at launch\u2014before they had Product Market Fit.\nBut once these companies get PMF, they don\u2019t just wait and hope that success will come along on its own. The next step is to bring the customers in.\nRyan Holiday is a media strategist and prominent writer on strategy and business.

Paradoxically, given the nature of its work, this is an area where one would assume that the most compassion in any society should be found. It does not add up. We need to reset our health and care services so they are fit for the 21st century.\nEveryone in Nigeria used to respect doctors and nurses. And why not? These are jobs that are as demanding as they are vital. Healthcare workers were seen as arbiters of life and death, a duty that was held sacred. But the endless cycle of strikes seem to be eroding much of this. While doctors, nurses, and other healthcare workers often have a genuine dissatisfaction with the facilities where they work, accessibility to drugs, and general conditions of service, the core issue at the heart of these strikes has been remuneration and status.\nPerhaps, it is time to expand this conversation beyond healthcare workers and government. Leaving it to healthcare workers and government in the past has only led to \u201ccollective bargaining agreements\u201d (CBAs) for improved wages and conditions of service that have been unsustainable. Government accedes to these collective agreements in the heat of each strike, and it quickly becomes obvious that it cannot fund the agreements, especially when other professions start agitating as well, and then we are back to square one, and a new cycle begins.\nAt the moment, there appears to be only one inevitable trajectory to the situation with strikes; more strikes, which lead to more disruption, which leads to more risks to the professional reputations of doctors and nurses, leading to more loss of public patience, and ultimately, this will inevitably lead to the failure of the public sector healthcare delivery system. Without radical reforms, it is hard to see how the current management arrangement of tertiary hospitals in Nigeria will survive. Just like NEPA and NITEL, we have started our descent.\nWe do not realise the damage done by strikes in our context because no one bothers to count. When junior doctors working in the UK\u2019s National Health Service (NHS) went on strike for two days recently, the first time this was happening in its history, it led to the cancellation of 125,000 operations and appointments. In Nigeria, strikes continue for months, with associated loss of life and income. If we counted the damage done by strikes in Nigeria, there would be widespread outrage.\nPicture credit: Orodata\nThe time has come to have a deeper conversation on the impact of strikes by health care workers on the lives of Nigerians. Nigerians can no longer afford to leave this to the professionals and the government to resolve. The Government is there to represent us, by allocating our common resources to pay health workers to provide care for us. It is time for us to raise our voices and assess how both our government and the healthcare workers employed on our behalf are fulfilling their responsibilities to us.\nIn order to achieve success, and stop this alarming descent, we must urgently commence an Indaba, a conversation process, whose recommendations must lead to implementation, and not be shelved like the many previous ones. We must find some eminent and credible Nigerians to lead this conversation. It will have to be led by someone outside of the key medical professions because of the loss of trust among health sector professionals.  During this Indaba, we must address some of the most fundamental issues facing the sector, which we have chosen to overlook over the years. There are five critical points that we think must be addressed:\nIntroduce accountability into patient-care - There must be a relationship between salaries in public sector hospitals and outcomes. Outcomes have to include both process outcomes, such as numbers of patients seen, clinical outcomes, as well as patient satisfaction. As long as there is no form of accountability in the sector, the only source of motivation to work is healthcare workers\u2019 altruism, which unfortunately is not sufficient in our context.\nUnderstand the appropriate doctor/nurse to patient ratio appropriate for each department in our tertiary hospitals - The situation at the moment where a single tertiary hospital has upwards of 20 consultants in a single department, and a handful in other departments, unrelated to activity, is simply unsustainable. Over the past few years, the government has continued hiring staff without any analysis of need or any understanding of workload. It is no surprise that they end up being unable to pay.\nDe-centralise salaries - Every tertiary hospital in Nigeria currently arranges its own procurement of everything from paracetamol to equipment. There is absolutely no point anymore for a uniform salary structure from Port Harcourt to Potiskum, from Abeokuta to Damaturu, when the circumstances, cost of living, work load and almost every criteria to determine pay is radically different across Nigeria. Trying to sustain a uniform pay band across Nigeria might provide for equality but definitely not equity.\nMake every tertiary hospital in Nigeria publish its accounts - In tertiary hospitals, the \u201cChief Medical Directors\u201d are Chief Executives with un-paralleled powers. Every decision begins and ends with them. Other than the annual publication of budgets, no one knows how much money they get from the Federal Government, from the National Health Insurance Scheme, from fee-paying patients or how much they are spending. Let Nigerians know how much of their money is going to salaries, medicines, equipment, etc.\nImplement that National Health Act \u2013 The new National Health Act provides for the establishment of a National Tertiary Health Institutions Standard Committee that would regulate tertiary health facilities, providing guidelines for the use of Tertiary Hospital Management Boards. If this is implemented, and hospitals held publicly accountable to its implementation, this will make the consequences of strikes much more immediate for each hospital.\nWe have always held the opinion at Nigeria Health Watch that strikes should be an extreme last option for healthcare workers.  A strike means walking out on our patients, leaving them in the ICUs and emergency rooms. We recognise the challenges that many Nigerian healthcare workers face, trying to deliver care in a context where many of the basic functions of society are broken or non-existent; and the responsibility of the employer to the employed. But we also believe that a person choosing healthcare as a profession must examine their motivation and understand the choices that they make.\nIt is time for this conversation to happen, or else our descent will continue, and it may just reach the point\u2026 of no-return."}, {"author": "Chikwe Ihekweazu", "headline": "On World Tuberculosis Day - Reflections on a Forgotten Epidemic", "body": "March 24 was World TB Day, yet for most people that have the privilege of reading this piece, tuberculosis is an abstract term.\nWhy would a disease that infects about half a million Nigerians every year, and kills about 170,000 annually attract so little attention from the government, the health professions and from the people? The answer is simple \u2013 it is a disease that disproportionately affects the poor and marginalised. It is widely recognised that the poorer the community, the greater the likelihood of being infected with the TB germ and developing clinical disease. A lack of basic health services, poor nutrition, inadequate living conditions and HIV all contribute to the spread of TB. With poor access to health services to diagnose or treat patients, there is a longer delay between disease and treatment, perpetuating the spread of TB. In a hyper-capitalist society like Nigeria, it is not hard to see why patients with tuberculosis fall through the cracks.\nThe first challenge in Nigeria, as with many other things, is to understand the size of the problem. Over the past four years, about 100,000 cases of all forms of TB were diagnosed in health centres across the country. However, in 2012/13, the National Tuberculosis and Leprosy Control Programme (NTLCP), under the leadership of Dr. Olusegun Obasanya at the time, conducted the first ever population based national prevalence survey, which revealed some shocking results.\nThe estimated overall prevalence was double what was being counted and the incidence (rate of new cases) a year was three times previous estimates. Assuming a resident population of 170 million in Nigeria, the estimated number of new cases of all forms of TB would be about 570,000, revealing a huge gap in case detection. This showed that Nigeria\u2019s case detection rate for all forms of TB currently stood at only 15 percent, one of the lowest case detection rates in the world.\nFor the cases that are detected, they are almost exclusively managed in the public sector, and the management of TB has been generally limited to \"Directly Observed Treatment Short course\" (or \u201cDOTS\u201d) centres and \u201cChest Clinics\u201d, a practice that belongs in the dark ages. Contemporary science suggests that there is no medical or public health reason why patients with TB should be diagnosed and managed in any out-patient setting separate from any other patient. Mycobacterium tuberculosis is such a poorly virulent organism that the risk of transmission in an outpatient clinic in our context is minimal. This practice has led to a whole generation of doctors who have little experience in how to manage patients with TB, because all they do is refer to \"DOTS\" centres. It is time to change this and normalise TB treatment, by bringing it back into primary health centres in Nigeria. The national TB strategic plan (2015 \u2013 2020) suggests an expansion of DOTS services to more facilities across the country in order to improve case notification rates. We suggest going a step further: make every public healthcare facility in Nigeria a \u201cDOTS Centre\u201d. Every functional public health care facility should have the capacity and resources to manage patients with TB.\nHowever, to get TB cases into care, they need to be diagnosed. This is being addressed to some extent by the roll of out of the Xpert MTB/RIF assay (carried out in \u201cGeneXpert machines\u201d) in Nigeria. The Xpert MTB/RIF assay is a new test that is changing tuberculosis (TB) diagnosis by enabling the rapid diagnosis of TB disease and drug resistance. The test simultaneously detects Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex (MTBC) and resistance to rifampin (RIF) in less than 2 hours. In comparison, standard cultures can take 2 to 6 weeks for MTBC to grow and conventional drug resistance tests can add 3 more weeks. Up to the end of 2015,there are just over 200 centres with GeneXpert machines in Nigeria. The policy has recently been changed to allow the use of Xpert MTB/RIF assay for the diagnoses of all potential TB cases without restrictions, where the test is available. The GeneXpert equipment is however very expensive, and these costs go way beyond the initial costs. This paper by Abdurrahman et al showed that the \u201chidden\u201d costs of installing these machines could be up to 3 times the cost of the machines themselves. In addition, because these rely heavily on constant electricity to work, their utility is limited to centres where this is available. Of the 200 centres in Nigeria, most are in the public sector, with 22 being in the private sector; predominantly faith-based not-for-profit hospitals. This March, the NTBLCP in collaboration with USAID conducted an assessment of the TB laboratory diagnostic capacity in Nigeria, including laboratory infrastructure, technology and human resources. The results from this will further guide the efforts to increase case detection in Nigeria.\nNigeria has the fourth highest annual number of TB cases in the world. We cannot get on top of this by passive detection of TB as is currently the case. Studies such as this one by Oshi et al shows that intensified case finding combined with capacity building, provision of work guidelines, and TB health education can improve TB notification.\nFor World TB Day 2016, WHO calls on governments, communities, civil society, and the private sector to \"Unite to End TB\". WHO and partners are promoting dialogue and collaboration that unites individuals and communities in new ways to end the tuberculosis (TB) epidemic. These efforts cut across disciplines and sectors, and can help accelerate progress towards the Sustainable Development Goals overall by contributing to other areas including poverty elimination, universal health coverage, maternal and child health, social protection and justice. The World Health Organizations\u2019s End TB Strategy envisions a world free of TB with zero deaths, disease and suffering. It sets targets and outlines actions for governments and partners to provide patient-centred care, pursue policies and systems that enable prevention and care, and drive research and innovations needed to end the epidemic and eliminate TB.\nEvery country is judged by how it treats its most vulnerable. Maybe it's time for us to stand up for ours. We can #EndTB, but we must reach the most vulnerable!\nWatch this short documentary on Drug resistant Tuberculosis on the rise in Nigeria."}, {"author": "Chikwe Ihekweazu", "headline": "Lack of trust in health sector: the underlying cause of the large Lassa Fever outbreak in Nigeria", "body": "Strange deaths in a community in Niger State in 2015 left the community confused, this was followed by a period of uncertainty and anxiety, and they reached out to the only rational explanation they could imagine \u2013 the supernatural. By the time the public health authorities were informed and a diagnosis of Lassa Fever was made, the outbreak had spread to many states. Control efforts included a mixture of persuasion to report suspicious cases to health authorities, establishment of task teams, and even an emergency meeting of the National Council of Health. One patient is reported to have \u201cescaped\u201d the hospital where he was being treated. The community was scared; they did not know who to trust.\nThe Nigerian Centre for Disease Control is evolving and Prof. Abdulsalami Nasidi has promised that its new Reference Laboratory in Kaduwa, Abuja will be ready for commissioning soon. On a morning television broadcast on the Nigerian Television Authority on the 20th of January he praised the efforts of the seven diagnostic centres in the country and promised to redouble control efforts. Colleagues in the Nigerian Field Epidemiology Training Programme are supporting the response.  As an epidemiologist myself, there is little that will make me prouder than a vibrant, professional Centre for Disease Control in Nigeria.\nHowever, the reality of this Lassa Fever outbreak, and all outbreaks that I have worked on in my many years as an infectious diseases epidemiologist have taught me that while epidemiology and diagnostic capacity are important components of health security, the most important line of defense may not be improved technology or quicker response times by my colleagues \u2013 epidemiologists, virologists, clinicians or surveillance officers.\nThe single most important factor in the control of outbreaks is trust in the health care system by the citizens of a country. A great \u201cCentre for Disease Control\u201d, is worth very little in the context of a public health care system that is largely dysfunctional, which its citizens do not trust.\nA lack of trust would not have prevented a few cases of Ebola emerging, but it was at the centre of the exponential spread of the Ebola outbreak in Liberia, Guinea and Sierra Leone, and at the heart of the challenges we faced during the response that I participated in, on the ground in Liberia. The need to focus on building trust in communities, and with their health care system is the most important lesson that I learnt from the response to the Ebola outbreak. A lack of trust in the public health care system is the most important reason the current Lassa Fever outbreak continues to spread.\nThe most likely transmission mechanism for the current Lassa Fever outbreak is person-to-person transmission. While rats are the likely source of initial infection, it is extremely unlikely, given the geographical distribution of cases that there is any on-going zoonotic source of infection. Therefore, to break the chains of transmission of the Lassa Fever virus, people must trust the health authorities enough to inform them of any signs of illness and not seek alternative sources of relief. Those infected and affected must trust that the healthcare workers\u2019 that they report to will treat them and care for them humanely in the presence of overwhelming historical evidence to the contrary.\nWhen a potential Lassa Fever patient declines to go into a primary health centre or hospital for care, this is often described as \u201cirrational\u201d and \u201cillogical\u201d behavior. Yet in the past the same healthcare workers have often failed to care for his child who had severe malaria, or failed to prevent the death of a sister following child birth? How could he be expected to suddenly trust the same health care worker that was never in his/her clinic all these years when he needed them?\nWhen this outbreak is over, the most likely scenario in Nigeria will be the re-start of the celebratory mode of the post Ebola period, rather than a period of introspection and retrospection. We will make speeches and pat ourselves on the back. However, this \u2018outbreak narrative\u2019 fails to capture the complexity of the underlying factor, trust, which I believe is largely responsible for the rapid spread and failure of initial control attempts of this outbreak. If we continue business as usual, we must expect the next outbreak pretty soon.\nThe most important line of defense for us in Nigeria is to rebuild our confidence in the capacity of our government to prioritize the health to its citizens.  This will require a complete turnaround in our health systems\u2019 capacity to respond to the \u201croutine\u201d health needs of a population. It is only by responding to these in \u201cpeacetime\u201d and building trust, will we have the capacity to respond better to the next crisis. Trust in our health systems will not prevent outbreaks (outbreaks of infectious diseases will always be with us), but it would most likely have prevented large outbreaks like the Lassa Fever one that we are experiencing. To do this, we need the Nigerian government to earn the confidence of its citizens in their ability to serve their interests and protect them.\nAs an infectious disease epidemiologist, my career has been built around measuring infectious disease burdens, determining trends, assessing risk factors and measuring the impact of control measures; this is my comfort zone. But I have learned that not everything that can be measured matters \u2013 and not everything that matters can be measured.\nTrust exemplifies this. When a society loses confidence in those to whom they would normally turn to in times of need, they resort to actions that can be generally considered \u201cirrational\u201d and illogical\u201d and unwittingly spread the disease further. Recognising this limitation has changed the way I view the relevance of my profession in the context of outbreak control. Learning from and applying this knowledge will be the most critical challenge of the post Lassa Fever outbreak period.\nNigerians, want their existing primary health centres to work. Only when trust is restored in the capabilities and compassion of the public health system can we hope to prevent large outbreaks from occurring. Restoring trust in existing primary health centres is much more important today than building 10,000 new ones."}, {"author": "Chikwe Ihekweazu", "headline": "Before the SDGs, how did Nigeria really do with the MDGS?", "body": "  By Chikwe Ihekweazu\nNigeria Health Watch\n\nIn August 2015, reports emerged in the Nigerian press that \u201cNigeria had attained the Millennium Development Goals\u201d.  The article above the Secretary of Programmes in the Office of the Senior Special Assistant to the President on MDGs, Mr. Ogenyi Ochapa, verbatim, with no critical commentary on the validity of his statement, which boldly declared: Nigeria has Attained HIV, Maternal Mortality MDGs ahead of Deadline!\nLate in September 2015, almost everyone in the Nigerian health establishment was in New York for the UN General Assembly (UNGA). It was at a side event of the UNGA, at the United Nations headquarters, that the country\u2019s final status report on the implementation of the Millennium Development Goals was released. We have tried to find out if there was a subsequent event in Nigeria to share this report with the Nigerian people, to no avail.\nOther than a few reports on the meeting in September, there has been almost no reportage on the report, or its outcomes. The entire development community has moved on to the new Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).One reason for this may be that the report itself is almost impossible to find. This most important report that describes the outcomes of a project that Nigeria and all supporting development partners invested billions of Naira is not on the website of the \u201cOffice of the Special Assistant to the President on MDGs\u201d as at the last time we accessed it, which was today, 10/11/15.\nBut it is important that we know if the \u201cGoals\u201d were achieved and what the outcomes of our investments were. So, we got hold of the MDGs End-Point Report and encourage you to read it.\nFirst, let\u2019s remind ourselves on what the Millennium Development Goals were meant to be. In 2000, at the United Nations Millennium Summit, 189 world leaders, including Nigeria\u2019s, adopted the Millennium Declaration to overcome poverty through a set of eight mutually reinforcing interrelated time-bound goals (MDGs) with related targets. One of the stated objectives of the \u201cGoals\u201d was to provide an \u201caccountability framework\u201d. The attractiveness of having goals is that simple statements can be made and communicated on if they were achieved or not. The MDGs were at the forefront of the global development agenda to eradicate poverty by 2015.\nIn Nigeria, as we do, in 2005 we created the Office of the Senior Special Assistant to the President on the Millennium Development Goals with Directors, Officers and a huge budget to provide guidance, coordination and oversight on the attainment of the MDGs.\nThere are eight goals, but for the purposes of our platform, lets examine how Nigeria did, from the report of the Office of the Senior Special Assistant, on the 3 health-related goals and associated targets; Goals 4, 5 and 6.\nGoal 4: Reduce Child Mortality \u2013 Target: Reduce by two-thirds, between 1990 and 2015, the under-five mortality rate. None of the indicators for this target; under-five mortality rate, infant mortality rate and the proportion of one year-old children immunized against measles were met in Nigeria.\nGoal 5: Improve Maternal Health \u2013 Target: Reduce by three-quarters, between 1990 and 2015, the maternal mortality ratio. The first indicator is on maternal mortality ratio, which the report says that Nigeria has met \u2013 from a baseline figure of 1000 deaths per 100,000 live births in 1990 to its end-point status of 243 per 100,000 live births in 2014.\nHowever this is contradicted by data from the Demographic and Health Survey done in Nigeria in 2013 and carried out by the National Population Commission and partners, which reported that the maternal mortality ratio in 2013 was 576 deaths per 100,000 births, an insignificant difference from the 2008 finding of 545 deaths per 100,000 births.\nDraw your own conclusions. None of the other indicators; proportion of births attended by skilled health personnel, unmet need for family planning, and antenatal care coverage were met.\nGoal 6: Combat HIV and AIDS, malaria and other diseases \u2013 Target: Have halted, by 2015, and begun to reverse the spread of HIV and AIDS. None of the nine indicators relating to HIV, TB and Malaria were met and on TB specifically, incident rates are actually increasing.\nIn summary, of the 16 indicators relating to three Millennium Development Goals relating to health, 15 were not met and only one was met. The one that was met, relating to maternal mortality is contradicted by data from a report considered to be the industry standard for that indicator, also commissioned by the same government.\nGranted, the MDGs were ambitious, and granted there has been some progress on many of the indicators, but there is really nothing to celebrate considering the funds invested by the Nigerian Government and development partners on behalf of the Nigerian people.\nBefore going full steam into committing funds to the new Sustainable Development Goals, it would be prudent to do a critical review on the approach taken by Nigeria. This is especially important as the government reaches conclusions on whether setting up a mini-parastatal as in the \u201cOffice of the Senior Special Assistant to the President on the Millennium Development Goals\u201d that was constructing buildings and boreholes across the country was the right approach rather than investing in the public institutions with a mandate to carry out these functions.\nWith a new government in place in Nigeria, just at the time the new SDGs have been agreed, there is no better time to ask these questions."}, {"author": "Chikwe Ihekweazu", "headline": "One year later, 5 most important lessons from the Nigerian Ebola Response ", "body": "By Chikwe Ihekweazu\nNigeria Health Watch\nOn October 20 2014, almost exactly one year ago, the World Health Organisation declared Nigeria Ebola free, 42 days after the last known case had occurred. At the time the world was in the grip of one of the largest and most terrifying public health disasters in generations.\nWhile not completely over, there are signs that we are finally getting to the end of this outbreak which has had an unprecedented impact on the sub-continent. The Ebola outbreak claimed thousands of people, including hundreds of doctors and health care workers and it will be a tragedy of immense proportions if lessons are not learnt and history repeats itself. While we wait for our governments and schools of public health to engage with this process, we offer a starting point of the reflection that should be happening across the country and continent.\nCompared to the three most affected countries, Nigeria had a relatively small outbreak. As the outbreak escalated in Liberia, Guinea and Sierra Leone, there was significant anxiety on the consequences of the introduction of the virus to Lagos, with its estimated population of 15 million, living in densely populated neighbourhoods. In many ways Nigeria was lucky that its first case entered the country through the main airport and presented to one of the most recognised private hospitals in Lagos. Here, the astute clinical acumen and professionalism of the staff of First Consultants Hospital Group led to the rapid diagnosis of Ebola and the sheer determination of its excellent group of clinicians prevented the patient from leaving the hospital at his request, most probably saving the country from many more infections. This was done at great personal sacrifice, with many of the team paying the ultimate price with their lives.\nSubsequently, the country experienced probably its finest hours in public health by rapidly mobilising the resources to mount a determined response. The rest is history, as the country managed to limit the number of cases to 19 with 10 deaths, confounding the predictions of doom that had spread around the world. Nigeria saved itself not only from a major public health crisis but also an economic one, as the consequences of exclusion from the global economy would have been a disastrous outcome for the country.\nOne year after the outbreak, it is important for the country to reflect both on what was achieved and how it was achieved, but most importantly we must ponder whether  the lessons learnt have formed the basis for the prevention of future outbreaks and the preparation of a more robust response in the future. We hope that the Federal Ministry of Health and its National Centre for Disease Control has carried out a similar exercise, or if not, that this piece inspires them to do so. We propose these five areas below as those that enabled the successful response in Nigeria and therefore should be further developed.\nCentral coordination through an \u201cEmergency Operations Centre\u201d (EOC)\nNigeria\u2019s rapid response to the introduction of Ebola benefited from having an established EOC that was funded and set up by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation to support the response towards the elimination of polio in Nigeria. The deputy incident manager of the polio EOC was rapidly deployed to lead theEbola EOC (watch a great interview with Dr Faisal Shuaib by Ebola Deeply). Nigerian authorities moved quickly to establish a co-ordinated response using EOC structures previously developed for its polio response and drew from its experience in setting up strict command and control structures to manage the response.\nAmong its activities, the team coordinated the follow up of thousands of contacts, developed a staffing plan that executed a social mobilization strategy that reached more than 26,000 households of people living around the contacts of Ebola patients, and ensured that resources required for the clinical management of cases were available. A number of partners from WHO, CDC, UNICEF and MSF were part of the EOC structure, however all reporting and communication was done through the incident manager appointed by the Ministry of Health for this purpose.  After the Ebola response using EOCs in Lagos and Port Harcourt, its core structure was moved to Abuja to maintain contingency arrangements. This has since faded away quietly. It is not clear what proactive steps the country is taking to sustain an operational EOC, nor where this would be located.\nThe public health function of the private hospitals\nIt is difficult to overstate the critical role that a culture of strong clinical governance and an awareness of public health responsibility played in shaping the response of the First Consultants Hospital Group in Lagos to the Ebola outbreak, led by Dr Adadevoh and her team . Population health as proposed by Kindig et al is a concept of health that focuses on \u201cthe health outcomes of a group of individuals, including the distribution of such outcomes within the group,\u201d and includes health outcomes, patterns of health determinants, and policies and interventions that link these two. Population health is primarily a goal\u2014a goal of achieving measurable improvements in the health of a defined population. Therefore it is important not only for those responsible for the health of populations, but for all those working in hospitals and clinics with a responsibility to deliver care to understand concepts such as prevalence, incidence, risk, and disease determinants at a population level in order to practise to a high level. If Dr Adadevoh and her team were not acutely knowledgeable on this, Nigeria would have ended up with a completely different outbreak. Dr. Ada Ighonoh, a young doctor at the hospital who survived Ebola, gave a personal account of how she survived and how she is using her second chance at life to prepare herself to prevent similar incidents from happening in the future. Every doctor should listen, and learn.\nCommunication matters more than ever during outbreaks\nDuring the outbreak, the media was saturated with messages on Ebola. It was on every media, on television, radio, on newspapers on social media. Suddenly there were Ebola experts everywhere and people were rapidly educated on the risks of the disease, the symptoms and what to do if one had symptoms. But this was not the case in the beginning of the outbreak, when stories on remedies such as \u201csalt water\u201d, \u201cbitter kola\u201d and \u201cNano Silver\u201d filled the airwaves as we clutched at straws, filled with anxiety. A completely volunteer group, EbolaAlert led by Dr Lawal Bakare rose out of Nigeria to be one of the most credible sources of information on Ebola. Led by young Nigerians, they quickly garnered over sixty thousand followers on twitter. At this time, there was virtually no usable information on the website of the Federal Ministry of Health and the Nigerian Centre for Disease Control did not and still does not have a website through which it can inform the population. The impact of poor communication was demonstrated acutely during the recent apparent Ebola\u201cscare\u201d in Calabar.\nInvesting in training and development: The National Field Epidemiology Training Programme example.\nA few years ago, with the support of the US CDC, the Field Epidemiology and Laboratory Training Program (FELTP) was set up in Nigeria.  This is a two-year competency-based training and service program in applied epidemiology and public health that builds the capacity to strengthen the surveillance and response systems of a country. It is managed by the Federal Ministry of Health, the Federal Ministry of Agriculture, in partnership with the University of Ibadan and Ahmadu Bello University in Zaria. The programme trains medical epidemiology residents, public health laboratory residents, and veterinary epidemiology residents for leadership positions. The field epidemiology component is similar to programs that have been established in more than 30 countries. Itis modeled after the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\u2019s (CDC) two-year Epidemic Intelligence Service (EIS) training program and is composed of 25% course work and 75% field work. Current and past fellows of the programme who were already trained in most of the requisite skills formed the bedrock of the contact tracing and case investigation teams during the Nigerian response. Having this cohort of experts readily available is a testament to the importance of investing in developing skills for the future.\n      5. Leadership\nThe leadership provided by the then Minister of Health, Professor Onyebuchi Chukwu, the then Governor of Lagos State, Babatunde Fashola, SAN, and his Commissioner for Health, Dr. Jide Idris were critical in controlling the outbreak. Despite some initial disagreements in approach, they maintained a collaborative framework in agreeing strategy and communication, recognising the lead responsibility of the Federal Government during major outbreak situations. They worked together to prevent the doomsday scenario of the rapid spread of the disease predicted in Nigeria. The function of leadership is not however limited to the public sector leaders but across the entire chain of command to the so-called \u201cboots on the ground\u201d that went house to house diligently following up on all the contacts.\nIronically, at the time of the outbreak, doctors working in public hospitals across Nigeria were on strike. This probably represents the biggest area of public sector leadership failure  in the health sector over the last decade.\nThere are definitely many other lessons that the outbreak has taught us, here we have offered our top five. Evaluations are only consequential if their results lead to change and improvement. There has been a lot of chest beating on the successful Nigerian response, now it is time to prepare for the future."}, {"author": "Chikwe Ihekweazu", "headline": "Three reasons Strikes will continue in Nigeria\u2019s Health Sector", "body": "No part of public service in Nigeria has experienced more strikes than the health sector.\nRight now, public tertiary hospitals in Nigeria are struggling to get back to life after another series of strikes. The University College Hospital, Ibadan, was crippled for 108 days by a strike called by the Association of Resident Doctors. At LAUTECH Oshogbo, a strike closed the hospital for 5 months, and in the Psychiatric Hospital in Yaba, doctors walked away from their duty posts leaving their patients to their own means.  The story of the Federal Medical Centre in Owerri is already legendary, as health workers came to \u201cwork\u201d every day but spent their time singing and praying on the hospital grounds, while ignoring their patients in the wards, protesting against the privatisation of some of the hospitals services. Their strike lasted for three months.\nThis story map details the major health sector strikes in 2015.\nLast year, many public sector hospitals across the country were closed for about half of the year following strikes as doctors refused to return to work, even during the Ebola outbreak. Almost as soon as they returned, other health sector workers under the aegis of the Joint Health Sector Unions (JOHESU) proceeded to strike from November 2014 to February 2015.\nWhen there are strikes in public sector hospitals, there are only two constituencies that suffer: a) the patients, and b) the tax-payer (i.e. you and I), who do not get a service that is paid for on our behalf by government. Other health workers not on strike all collect their full salaries and allowances, the health workers on strike are ultimately paid in most cases, and even the hospital still gets its normal allocation from the Federal Ministry of Health as well as its quarterly \u201callocation\u201d from the National Health Insurance Scheme, whether any of its\u2019 patients covered by the scheme received clinical care during that quarter or not. So, for health workers and hospitals there are few, if any, consequences from strikes.\nAs professional bodies in the health sector prepare for strike actions, they tend to make three assumptions which make the decision so easy in Nigeria. Below we examine these assumptions and highlight how they may not continue to hold in the future:\nGovernment will always settle, eventually: Let\u2019s tell ourselves the simple truth. Government has always settled. Not only have they always settled, they have not asked or received anything tangible in return.  Salaries have increased without any change to the quality of service delivered. The complexity of health and measuring impact makes accountability difficult. So, unlike in most other contexts, no doctor working in the public sector in Nigeria has a contract or specification that states what the clinical expectations are in terms of the service he/she is delivering.  There are no contracts with surgeons that state how many cases they are contracted to do, or how many patients physicians are expected to see. This also applies to other categories of health workers; and crucially also applies at institutional level. There are no process indicators, no quality indicators, no outcome indicators and definitely no patient satisfaction indicators. We do not know how many patients each public health facility is expected to see or what standard of service they are supposed to deliver. So there is absolutely no way for government (us) to know if we are getting value for money. We can pay salaries as high as we like, but until we link pay and funding to performance, nothing will change.  Although this has never happened, it is only a matter of time, until government starts asking for value for money from the sector.\nThe patients will always return: This is an assumption that we are glad to say is already being proven wrong. Patients will not always return, even those at the poorer end of the socioeconomic spectrum. A tour round many of the teaching and other public hospitals will reveal that many beds are empty, and increasingly so. There is a quiet evolution going on in the private health care sector in Nigeria. Previously, the sector was inherently inefficient with many two to four bed hospitals, whose ineffective management tended to charge over-the-top fees for the handful of patients unfortunate enough to end up in their care. This is changing, as a series of innovative groups are pulling together resources to build clinical collaborations that will enable high utilisation of services, lower costs and better care in the private sector.  Once this gains momentum, there will be less and less of a reason to go to many of the public sector hospitals. It will only be a matter of time for government to realise that they cannot continue funding these hospitals, when patients seek their care elsewhere.  Money will begin to follow the patient.\nStriking workers will always return to their jobs: This is the strongest of all the assumptions. However, staff of NITEL and NEPA also once thought that they would always have their jobs. If there are insufficient patients in most public sector hospitals and these hospitals are forced to close, the inevitable consequence is that there will simply be nothing to do in them. This is a natural consequence; it can be slowed, but cannot be stopped.\nThere are only two possible end points for the scenario playing out in the Nigerian public health care sector at the tertiary level; complete disintegration of the publicly delivered tertiary health care (similar to what happened with NITEL, NEPA) or a complete turn around. As it stands, the health  sector is surely and firmly walking towards self-destruction.  Too many health professions in Nigeria are so focused on their professional interests and egos that they seem to have lost sight of the bigger picture. In fighting for the ball, we are destroying it. If this continues, the outcome is inevitable. There will be nothing left to fight over.\nThe need has never been greater for real leadership to emerge from the professional bodies that will be willing to put the patient as the client front and centre of their action. There may only be a tiny window of opportunity to change course. Chances are that it is already too late\u2026 and that the downward spiral is well on its way.\nStill, we grasp for even a hint of light at the end of the tunnel, that our hopes may rise once again."}, {"author": "Chikwe Ihekweazu", "headline": "Can technology-based measurement transform the Nigerian Health Sector?", "body": "Can technology-based measurement transform the Nigerian Health Sector?\n0\nBy Chikwe Ihekweazu on Africa Diaspora Health Nigeria Technology\nThe Nigerian Banking Sector is almost unrecognizable compared to where it was just a few years ago. As a consumer, you can get cash from almost any ATM in Nigeria, transact business in any bank, pay for goods by mobile phone, and confirm transactions in seconds. You have access to statements 24/7, at least as long as there is connectivity. In addition to increasing the ease of transactions, the other major impact of these changes has been increased accountability and transparency, not just for the banks but for every individual or firm using bank services.\nIn contrast, our public sector hospitals these days seem to be constantly shut as one of several groups of health professionals is almost always on strike. While we may guess, we really do not know the impact this has on the Nigerian Health Sector. It is almost impossible to get data on how many surgeries surgeons actually carry out in our teaching hospitals or how many deliveries the midwives have performed in a month. What if we knew how many contact-hours medical students had with patients before being released to the world with that god-like title of \u201cDoctor\u201d? Would it make a difference to the perception we have of our apparently great healthcare institutions if we actually knew what they were \u201cproducing\u201d per naira of funds allocated? As budgets tighten for our governments, these questions will get even louder because healthcare is an expensive business. The biggest irony of all salary negotiations with health sector professionals in Nigeria is that they take place in the absence of any data on productivity.\nI have been reading about one of the greatest technology personalities of our time, more so since his interest in the health sector has grown; Bill Gates. One philosophy of his that has stuck with me is his reputed obsession for measurement. In his annual letter in 2013, Gates makes the case for how measurement has driven some of the biggest recent public health successes of this era. There is no doubt that improved data collection and sharing in Nigeria has been critical to the recent progress on polio in Nigeria.\nIncreasing accountability, efficiency and profitability in the health sector is not possible without the tools for measurement. Technology, especially mobile, has the power to transform the delivery of healthcare services and improve compliance, accountability and care. Driven by some of the fastest mobile subscriber growth in the world, cheaper mobile devices, and continued innovation, emerging mobile health solutions are already saving lives \u2013 an estimated 1 million of them by 2017, according to a recentreport by PricewaterhouseCoopers.\nDespite the growing interest in Mobile Health (mHealth) initiatives globally, adoption rates of mobile solutions has been slow in Nigeria. An emerging opportunity exists for healthcare providers to adopt mobile technology to not only to improve the effectiveness of healthcare delivery but to also measure and demonstrate results.\nWhile the sector is eager for mHealth solutions, most care providers in Nigeria still lack the required infrastructure to support widespread deployment of apps that might integrate personal medical information. Healthcare organisations will need to start from the basics, e.g. the deployment of Electronic Medical Records (EMR) systems, from which relevant data can be extracted and integrated into mobile health apps. When you consider that one of the major hospital groups in Nigeria, Lagoon hospitals only announced a full adoption of electronic medical records in 2013, it demonstrates how far the distance still is. Most medical records of patients in Nigeria are stored in folders as shown below.\nPaper Records at a Nigerian Hospital\nOne firm that is making progress in this space is Sabaoth Technologies Ltd, an all-purpose medical information systems firm, which is currently providing hospital information management systems to the Delta State University Teaching Hospital, Oghara and University College Hospital Ibadan in the public sector as well as several private hospitals.\nThere are other firms now making inroads into the health space. If you have not heard about the IT and logistics platform Integrahealth, note the name. Their flagship product \u2018DrugStock\u2019 enables the purchase of good quality drugs, managing the supply chain, payments, and capacity building for medium size hospitals mostly in Lagos, Nigeria. The co-founder Chibuzor Opara was at the World Economic Forumthis year speaking about their dream of increasing efficiency of hospitals in Nigeria and beyond.\nEarly in 2015, the Private Sector Health Alliance hosted \u201cThe Health Innovation Challenge;\u201d a multi-stage competition to recognise, reward and celebrate innovations that show potential to improve health in Nigeria. Several innovative firms and ideas competed for the challenge and some of these ideas will grow to dominate the sector in their niches in a few years.\nThere are also several examples from outside our shores. In Zambia, the government partnered with IBM to deploy a mobile program aimed at better managing the inventory and delivery of 200 life-saving prescription drugs. Staff members from three local health facilities are now using mobile devices with barcode scanners to record stock and generate real-time views of supplies. The solution also allows workers to transfer supplies and identify trends, thereby preventing gaps in the medical supply chain and ensuring that citizens have access to the medications they need.\nWhether it is in the public or private sectors, demands for data and information for multiple purposes, including performance improvement, accountability, and stakeholder decision making, are likely to increase in the future.  At the same time, there is a growing tech community with technology startups, developers and a fast-moving technology ecosystem which has been dubbed Silicon Lagoon.\nThe reason we are not measuring enough in the public sector is not because we lack the tools or the technology. It is also not for a lack of need or demand, but mostly it is because it\u2019s convenient for many not to measure, so that we do not know. Ignorance, for them, is bliss\u2026\nIf we want to transform our health sector, we must begin to measure performance. We may be shocked by what we find.\n  P/s: If you know of  projects, initiatives, ideas using technology innovatively in our health sector please share with us on twitter @nighealthwatch"}, {"author": "Chikwe Ihekweazu", "headline": "Liberia is declared Ebola free: can Nigeria support its Neighbours more?", "body": "Thankfully, Liberia is on its way back. The Ebola outbreak has been declared over, and life is returning to \u201cnormal\u201d. The streets are full of activity, and schools have reopened. Across the country, there is an unmistakable sense that people are desperate to get on with their lives.\nArriving Monrovia in January 2015, it felt familiar; like a mid-sized Nigerian town \u2013 perhaps Abakiliki or Ilorin. The food was familiar \u2013 fish, plantain, rice \u2026 with lots of red pepper. The electricity situation was still very poor, and most people in Monrovia relied on generators. As we drove past a white compound, the driver explained that it belonged to Charles Taylor. I shuddered as I thought of all the lives lost in a senseless civil war. About half a kilometer down the road, we passed another big white building on the left of Tubman Boulevard. It had \u201cNigeria House\u201d boldly inscribed on it. It\u2019s the Nigerian High Commission. The driver went on to explain with a sense of gratitude and respect the role that Nigeria had played in Liberia\u2019s history. I could not remember any other country that I had been to where I consistently had received such a warm welcome as in Liberia. I was proud.\nThe UN still had a military mission in Liberia. In the UN compound, there was a mix of military and police uniformed guys all around. I immediately noticed the uniform of the Nigerian police in the mix. The good work done by Nigeria around the sub-continent is often not recognised enough by Nigerians at home. Monrovia, Liberia\u2019s capital is home to about a third of the 4 million Liberians.  As is almost always the case, I ran into a number of Nigerian colleagues working in the various organisations responding to the outbreak, and we soon formed a tight bond. I slowly found my way around Monrovia.\nFrom the outside, with all the horror stories of Ebola in the popular press, it is easy to imagine Liberia as a country on the brink, especially with its history of protracted conflicts and civil war. But there is nothing further from the truth. Yes, it had been ill prepared for an outbreak of this severity and magnitude, as many other countries would have been, but sometimes there is nothing as powerful as grief to unite people in seeking a better future. The most important line of defence for Liberia is to rebuild the confidence of its population in the capacity of its government to prioritize the health of its citizens. This will require a complete turnaround in its health system\u2019s capacity to respond to the \u201croutine\u201d health needs of a population. It\u2019s only by responding to these issues in \u201cpeacetime\u201d and building trust, that it will have the capacity to respond better to the next crisis. When a society loses confidence in those to whom they would normally turn to in times of need, they resort to actions that can generally be considered \u201cirrational\u201d and \u201cillogical\u201d and unwittingly spread the disease further.\nIn order to rebuild their health system, Liberia will need the support of other West African countries, especially Nigeria.  At the beginning of the outbreak, Liberia was widely reported to have about 50 doctors working in the country;  one of the lowest physician-to-population ratios in the world. In Nigeria, there are over 30 medical colleges producing about 3,000 doctors annually. Perhaps, it is time to form strong regional alliances between the various postgraduate colleges in a win-win situation  including training and service for all the countries in the region. The same concept could apply to nursing professionals, pharmacists and medical laboratory scientists. However, this will only work if we are able to go about this with humility and a sense of service, not one of pride and arrogance.  \nFor Nigeria, it is time to think of our engagement with the sub-continent beyond the military and the police. Not many people may know about the \u201cTechnical Aid Corps (TAC)\u201d scheme that was established by the military regime of General Ibrahim Babangida in 1987 (like many other important institutions in Nigeria, it has no website for the public to follow its work). The sole purpose of the scheme is assisting States in Africa, Caribbean and specific regions in their social-economic development effort. Nigerian experts in various fields of human endeavour participate. Its most recent deployments are reported to be Uganda and Rwanda. Rwanda? I can guess what you are thinking! Until we begin to hold these Nigerian institutions to account on how they represent the strategic interests of our country, we cannot expect much to change.\nOut of this crisis must emerge a new Liberia. While the stories of dictators, civil war and Ebola are true, they cannot be Liberia\u2019s \u201csingle story\u201d. With a beautiful beach front right at the heart of the city, there is no reason for Monrovia not to be the favorite destination of Nigeria\u2019s emerging middle class. As Liberia grows, it will also begin to engage with the various opportunities in Nigeria. The earlier we really begin to see West-Africa for the common market that it should be, the greater the opportunities will be for the continent.\nFor now, it\u2019s just great that Liberia can get on with the difficult task of nation building."}, {"author": "Chikwe Ihekweazu", "headline": "Something to be proud of: Nigeria\u2019s Role in the AU Response to the Ebola Outbreak", "body": "There is increasing optimism that we will get to the end of the Ebola epidemic that has so badly affected Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea over the past year. In the first week of April, the lowest number of cases (30) were reported since May 2014. While there may still be some challenges ahead, the scale of the response and the translation of several learning points from the early part of the response have led to the quiet optimism that the end is in sight. This optimism is shared by responding organisations as well as health care workers in the most affected countries. Most of the current conversations have begun to focus on the restoration of health services with a strict infection control and prevention component. One organisation that has played a major role in this response but not gotten as much credit as it deserves is the \u201cAfrican Union\u201d (AU).\nWhile I was in Liberia earlier this year supporting the Ebola respose, I worked with epidemiologists, doctors, nurses, pharmacists and public health officers that are part of the African Union Support to Ebola Outbreak in West Africa (ASEOWA). ASEOWA is the African Union\u2019s contribution to on-going efforts to stop the transmission of the Ebola Virus Disease (EVD) in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone. Under Operation ASEOWA, health professionals were mobilized from around the African continent and deployed to the affected countries to assist with outbreak control efforts. This is the first time ever that the AU is initiating and implementing a mission of this size in response to a health crisis on the continent. The mission has  contributed significantly both in supporting the public health as well as clinical response to the outbreak. It contributed epidemiologists, who became part of the outbreak response activities, and clinicians supporting the restoration of critical health services.\nThe ASEOWA team of close to a thousand colleagues was made up of large contingents from Nigeria, Kenya and Ethiopia. Being Africans themselves, most of the ASEOWA team quickly integrated into various aspects of the response and rapidly gained the confidence of local colleagues. Whenever necessary, they joined teams in the field, going to some of the \u201chardest-to-reach\u201d areas to support various outbreak control activities. As the cases began to decline, members of the team were increasingly deployed into healthcare facilities to support activities that would lead to the restoration of services to the population. They acted not just as rare clinical resource in this situation but also provided emotional support and inspiration to other colleagues who felt exhausted and anxious after months of working under such difficult circumstances.\nThis being the first deployment of human resources in a health mission ever by the AU, there were some teething problems. Some colleagues had to wait longer than necessary before they were deployed to specific roles, and there were some uncertainties about where exactly their skills could be optimally utilised within the large response. The deployment of close to a thousand colleagues also required significant human resources management and logistics. There will definitely be many lessons to learn.  A comprehensive and independent evaluation of Operation ASEOWA is needed to learn vital lessons, both from the deployed individuals and the receiving countries\nThe large Nigerian delegation was ably led by Dr Joshua Obasanya, deployed from the Nigerian Centre for Disease Control. He was until recently the Director of Nigeria\u2019s Tuberculosis Control Program so came with years of experience of managing not only one of the oldest diseases known to man but one that had similar difficult elements that are key to the control such as \u201ccontact tracing\u201d. He was also part of the team that contained the outbreak of Ebola in Nigeria.\n\n\nDr Obasanya, leader of the Nigerian Delegation and Deputy Head of the ASEOWA team in Liberia\nThere have been recent pronouncements about the potential establishment of an \u201cAfrican Centre for Disease Control\u201d, maybe following the European model \u201cEuropean Centre for Disease Control\u201d. While this is a great idea on face value, it may be a bit premature. Right now, priority should be given to strengthen each country\u2019s capacity to carry out their statutory responsibility of responding to infectious disease threats in their own countries. In addition, the international health regulations actually provide an excellent framework for action from the international community when this is needed. While there is general agreement that this may not have worked optimally in this response, emphasis should be laid on strengthening capacity in individual countries rather than creating new organisations with uncertain mandates. The primary responsibility of preventing, managing and controlling infectious disease threats should remain firmly with each country.\nHowever, in exceptional circumstances like this, the AU should indeed be well placed to mobilize resources from countries like Nigeria, and it has done this fairly successfully during this response. Hopefully, there will be many lessons to be learnt, so that, while we are grateful for all the help from outside, the skills and experience gained by African colleagues on this mission will serve the continent well.\nWe look forward to welcoming those of our ASEOWA colleagues, who are still in the field, back home."}, {"author": "Chikwe Ihekweazu", "headline": "ON WORLD TB DAY, THERE IS LITTLE TO CELEBRATE IN NIGERIA", "body": "First published on Nigeria Health Watch.\nAs the Ebola epidemic in West Africa slows and falls away from the headlines, there is a temptation to view this outbreak as an isolated event and go back to life as usual. In Nigeria, the fairly successful response to the Ebola epidemic has brought a bit of credibility to the Nigerian health sector, with many Nigerian public health professionals smiling when confronted with the question \u201cHow did you guys do it?\u201d While there is definitely some satisfaction to be gained in the response to the Ebola outbreak in Nigeria, it does not change the fact that we are still in a precarious situation with several other infectious disease threats, which kill thousands of people in Nigeria. No other disease illustrates better our collective inability to deliver the essentials of a modern public health response to those who need help the most, in the most timely and efficient manner, than our response to tuberculosis (TB).\nWhile diseases like Ebola kill swiftly and produce horrific and acute symptoms, TB consumes many of its unknowing victims over a long period. It often goes undiagnosed for months, if not years, while it multiplies in families and communities. People infected with TB are often poor, marginalised and voiceless. Individuals who are ill with TB and not treated, can spread the bacteria through the air. Without correct treatment, more than 80 percent of people who fall ill will eventually waste away \u2014 coughing up blood while their bodies are ravaged by the disease \u2014 until they die. The difference is that they do not die in days, but in months \u2026 sometimes years.\nFor many years, there has been widespread suspicion that most of the cases of TB occurring in Nigeria are not detected by the system and are never able to access care. Under-diagnosis is probably the most significant reason for the low numbers of cases reported in Nigeria. TB diagnosis and care is only available in the public sector and in a few faith-based healthcare facilities. However, these sites are very unappealing for patients, as they are often poorly maintained inaccessible and located at the corners of hospitals.\nThe derelict \u201cChest Unit\u201d of the University of Nigeria Teaching Hospital (UNTH) hidden away at its old site\nThe first ever population based TB prevalence survey, (an attempt at measuring the burden of TB ) was conducted in Nigeria in 2012. Data from this survey provides some context to the low case notification data. The survey revealed a doubling of the estimated overall prevalence (the total number of people with TB) and a tripling of the estimated incidence (the total number of new cases) from previous WHO estimates. Based on the survey\u2019s findings, Nigeria\u2019s population of 170 million , in 2012, the estimated number of new cases of all forms of TB should have been about 550,000. However, Nigeria notified a total of only 97,000 new cases of all forms of TB in 2012, revealing a huge gap in case detection. Using these updated figures, Nigeria\u2019s case detection rate for all forms of TB currently stands at approximately 17 percent, one of the lowest case detection rates in the world. Based on the 2012 prevalence survey data, the country and WHO have updated their estimates for TB prevalence and incidence in Nigeria. This data is publicly available here.\nIn recent decades, we\u2019ve seen a surge in the number of people falling ill with strains of TB that are highly resistant to conventional treatment , which left untreated, kill rapidly. These strains are called multi drug resistant tuberculosis (MDR TB). Overall, the mean annual percentage increase in MDR-TB exceeded 100% in Nigeria, while MDR-TB case detection in 2012 was <10%. This means that most of the estimated 3,000 case of MDR TB in Nigeria are not diagnosed and do not enter the care pathway.\nAll over the world, tuberculosis is a difficult disease \u2013 difficult to diagnose and difficult to treat. But for the first time in years there is some real excitement on the TB scene with more rapid accurate diagnostic tools becoming available. Xpert MTB/RIF is a new test that simultaneously detects both the bacteria that causes TB and resistance to rifampicin, one of the main drugs used for its treatment directly from sputum in under two hours. WHO has recommended the use of the technology since December 2010 and is monitoring its global roll-out to promote coordination. A list of all the sites that have procured this new diagnostic option can be found here.\nMore than ever before, the Ebola outbreak presents the responsible public health departments and agencies in Nigeria with an opportunity to engage the attention of the Nigerian people to call for collective action to prevent future outbreaks and build capacity to respond to ongoing ones. We have a moral obligation to lend our voices to this broader struggle. We have learnt from the HIV/AIDS global epidemic that robust health systems are critical in mounting and sustaining a vigorous response to an emerging disease threat. This 2014 Ebola outbreak provides a unique opportunity to rebuild and strengthen health systems and should lead to much more robust investment in public health.\nTo find out how Nigeria has spent the US$ 147,354,856 that it received from the Global Fund in grants since the inception of the fund, go to their website here. To find out more about the Nigerian National TB Control Program, we would normally refer you to their website, but \u2026 it is \u201cdown\u201d. To find data on TB in Nigeria, sadly, you will have to go to the WHO website here.\nOn World TB Day, 24 March, WHO is calling for new commitments and new action in the global fight against tuberculosis. The call is most urgent in Nigeria. We are sitting and watching a ticking bomb. With the release of the first ever nationwide MDR TB and TB Prevalence surveys in Nigeria, one would have expected a massive scale up in the response, but very little seems to have changed \u2026"}][{"author": "Alec Ross", "headline": "The advice Shimon Peres gave me years ago that I'll always remember", "body": "Let me share a personal story about Nobel Peace Prize winner Shimon Peres, who passed away yesterday, and the enduring lessons of that story.\nA number of years ago, I was a young diplomat in Italy and scheduled to have a foreign policy debate with well-known former Ambassador to the United Nations, John Bolton. I knew that Bolton would not have heard of me, would not prepare, and would not particularly care about the sensibilities of the audience, which was made up of several hundred prominent executives, mostly Italian CEOs. When we met, he did not look at me, he just looked over my shoulder to see if someone more important or famous might be around. I\u2019m sure ambassador Bolton probably thought sharing the stage with some young guy was beneath him.\nI volunteered that the ambassador should go first, given his standing. He accepted and delivered a monologue that had little to do with the topic. Just the well-known one-liners and doctrine of ambassador John Bolton. His greatest hits, so to speak. None of it responded to the specific interests of the businessmen in the audience.\nI had prepared thoroughly, and after ambassador Bolton made his points, I responded with my opening remarks in Italian and included a joke that got everyone laughing, which Bolton of course could not understand since he did not speak Italian. I pulled two or three other little things like that, which were a product of preparation and caring about who was in the audience.\nBottom line, the young unknown diplomat destroyed the celebrity. Afterwards, Shimon Peres (who was sitting in the front row) came up to me and whispered in his distinct, gravelly voice, \"young man, you have demonstrated how to engage in asymmetrical warfare.\" We spoke later that night, and he told me that whenever a lesser experienced or lesser known person goes into competition with someone more experienced and better known, to make that person\u2019s standing a weaknesses. To match his lazy preparation with over-preparation. To match his seriousness and arrogance with a measure of levity and two measures of humility. Bolton was so humiliated that he did not come to dinner that night and left the conference a day early.\nFour weeks ago, I saw president Peres again. We were both back in Italy at the same place on Lake Como. We had our last conversation, discussing Russia, while drinking wine on a gorgeous Italian night. At the beginning of our conversation, I re-introduced myself to him. He smiled and said, \u201cI know who you are and I remember our conversation after the debate many years ago about asymmetrical combat. I know who you are because even though I am 93-years-old, I still prepare every day as though I am still a young man without the benefit of power and standing.\u201d President Peres explained to me that he read the biographies of everybody that would be at dinner and this reminded him of our earlier encounter. He was exhibiting the lessons that he ingrained when he was my age: preparation, understanding your surroundings and not relying on experience and celebrity.\nThat a 93-year-old Nobel Peace Prize winning president of a nation can do this until the end of his life inspires me to try to do the same.\nAlec Ross is the author of The Industries of the Future, from Simon & Schuster."}, {"author": "Alec Ross", "headline": "An open letter from technology sector leaders on Donald Trump\u2019s candidacy for President", "body": "We are inventors, entrepreneurs, engineers, investors, researchers, and business leaders working in the technology sector.

The coming decade will see societies transform as humans learn to live alongside robots.\nJapan is home to the longest-living citizens on earth and the biggest elderly population of any country\u2014and it\u2019s not getting any younger. Japan\u2019s current life expectancy is 80 years for men and 87 years for women and is expected to rise to 84 and 91, respectively, over the next 45 years. Between 2010 and 2025, the number of Japanese citizens 65 years or older is expected to increase by 7 million. Today, 25 percent of Japan\u2019s population is age 65 or older. By 2020, this is projected to increase to 29 percent and reach 39 percent by 2050.\nAll of those long-living elderly will need caretakers. Yet Japan\u2019s low birthrates mean that what once was a staple of Japanese family life\u2014taking care of one\u2019s grandparents and great-grandparents\u2014will no longer be a viable model at the scale the nation needs. There will not be enough grandchildren.\nWith Japan\u2019s persistently strict immigration policies curtailing the number of workers in the country, there will not be enough humans around to do the job at all. Japan\u2019s Ministry of Health, Labor, and Welfare predicts a need for 4 million eldercare nurses by 2025. Right now there are only 1.49 million in the country. Japan allows only 50,000 work visas annually, and unless something drastic changes, the math does not work.\nThis labor shortage will hit service-industry jobs like eldercare with ferocity and will be exacerbated because caretakers have a high job turnover rate due to low pay and high rates of work-related injury from lifting patients.\nEnter the robots.\nOur future caretakers are being developed in a Japanese factory right now. Just as Japanese companies reinvented cars in the 1970s and consumer electronics in the 1980s, they are now reinventing the family. The robots depicted in the movies and cartoons of the 1960s and 1970s will become the reality of the 2020s.\nRival Japanese companies Toyota and Honda are leveraging their expertise in mechanical engineering to invent the next generation of robots. Toyota built a nursing aide named Robina\u2014modeled after Rosie, the cartoon robot nanny and housekeeper in The Jetsons\u2014as part of their Partner Robot Family, a line of robots to take care of the world\u2019s growing geriatric population. Robina is a \u201cfemale\u201d robot, 60 kilograms in weight and 1.2 meters tall, that can communicate using words and gestures. She has wide-set eyes, a moptop hairdo, and even a flowing white metallic skirt.\nRobina\u2019s brother, Humanoid, serves as a multipurpose home assistant. He can do the dishes, take care of your parents when they\u2019re sick, and even provide impromptu entertainment: one model plays the trumpet, another the violin. Both versions are doppelgangers for the famous Star Wars C-3PO robot, although in gleaming white instead of gold.\nIn response, Honda has created ASIMO (the Advanced Step in Innovative Mobility robot), a fully functional humanoid that looks like a four-foot-tall astronaut stuck on Earth. ASIMO is sophisticated enough to interpret human emotions, movements, and conversation. Equipped with cameras that function as eyes, ASIMO can follow voice commands, shake hands, and answer questions with a nod or by voice. He even bows to greet others, demonstrating good Japanese manners. For an elderly patient, ASIMO can fulfill a range of tasks, from helping the patient get out of bed to holding a conversation.\nHonda is also focusing much of its research and commercialization on robotic limbs and assistance devices that are robotic but not free-standing robots. Its Walking Assist device wraps around the legs and back of people with weakened leg muscles, giving them extra power to move on their own. In the future, expect to see Honda making robotic hands and arms. Its goal is nothing less than helping paraplegics walk and the very frail rediscover the speed and power of their youth.\nNumerous other Japanese companies are pushing the big players like Toyota and Honda. Tokai Rubber Industries, in conjunction with the Japanese research institute RIKEN, has unveiled the Robot for Interactive Body Assistance (RIBA), which can pick up and set down humans up to 175 pounds and is designed for patient comfort: it resembles a giant smiling bear and is covered in a soft skin to guard against injury or pain.\nSimilarly, Japanese industrial automation company AIST has created PARO, a robot baby harp seal covered in soft white fur. PARO exhibits many of the same behaviors as a real pet. Designed for those who are too frail to care for a living animal or who live in environments that don\u2019t allow pets, such as nursing homes, it enjoys being held, gets angry when hit, and likes to nap.When President Barack Obama met PARO a few years ago on a tour of Japanese robotics innovations, he instinctually reached out and rubbed its head and back. It looks like a cute stuffed animal, but costs $6,000 and is classified by the US government as a class 2 medical device.\nJapan already leads the world in robotics, operating 310,000 of the 1.4 million industrial robots in existence across the world. It\u2019s turning to eldercare robots in part because it has to and in part because it, uniquely, is in a great position to leverage its advanced industrial technology toward the long assembly line of the human life span. But can robots really take care of humans?\n\u201cFor the idea of artificial companionship to be our new normal, we have to change ourselves, and in the process we are remaking human values and human connection.\u201d \u2014 Sherry Turkle, MIT professor\nJapan\u2019s private and public sectors certainly think so. In 2013, the Japanese government granted $24.6 million to companies focusing on eldercare robotics. Japan\u2019s prominent Ministry of Economy, Trade, and Industry chose 24 companies in May 2013 to receive subsidies covering one-half to two-thirds of the R&D costs for nursing care robots. Tasks for these robots include helping the elderly move between rooms; keeping tabs on those likely to wander; and providing entertainment through games, singing, and dancing.\nNevertheless, difficult challenges remain. On the technical side, it remains difficult to design robots capable of intimate activities like bathing patients or brushing their teeth. And most Japanese companies that are developing these robots specialize in industrial motors and electronic automation. They didn\u2019t enter the caretaking field with a keen grasp of how to forge an emotional connection, a crucial aspect of eldercare. Even as they improve, some observers\u2014 like Sherry Turkle, a professor of the social studies of science and technology at MIT\u2014question whether patients will ever be able to form a true emotional connection with robot caretakers. As Turkle warns, \u201cFor the idea of artificial companionship to be our new normal, we have to change ourselves, and in the process we are remaking human values and human connection.\u201d\nIf robot nurses catch on, she explains, they may even create a chasm between younger and older generations. \u201cIt\u2019s not just that older people are supposed to be talking,\u201d Turkle argues, referring to the goal of creating robots that can hold conversation, \u201cyounger people are supposed to be listening. We are showing very little interest in what our elders have to say. We are building the machines that will literally let their stories fall on deaf ears.\u201d\nThese technical questions (Can a robot brush a person\u2019s teeth?) and almost-spiritual doubts (Can, and should, emotional connections be made between humans and robots?) are both valid. Yet robot technology and applicability continue to advance in Japan, and answers to these questions will likely arise there in the near future. With too few caretakers, I expect robots to become a regular part of the Japanese family system.\nIf the aging nation can pull it off, robot caretakers will be a boon for its economy and will soon make the jump to the global economy, with potentially far-reaching consequences.\nMuch of the rest of the industrialized world is on the verge of a period of advanced aging that will mirror Japan\u2019s own. In Europe, all 28 member states of the European Union have populations that are growing older, and in the decades ahead, the percentage of Europe\u2019s population aged 65 and older will grow from 17 percent to 30 percent. China is already entering a period of advanced aging even as it continues to develop. Although its one-child policy is already being phased out, China is now demographically lopsided. Chinese women have on average 1.4 children, well below the replacement rate of 2.1, resulting in too few young people to provide for the elderly. The notable exception is the United States, where immigration policies partially mitigate the effects of an aging population.\nAs the populations of developed nations continue to age, they create a big market for those Japanese robots. And caretaking robots, alongside robotic limb technology, may simply be the first in a new wave of complex robots entering our everyday lives. Robots will be the rare technology that reaches the mainstream through elderly users first, spreading down as grandma shows off her next cutting-edge gadget for the kids and grandkids.\nTHE GEO-ROBOTIC LANDSCAPE\nThe robot landscape will be vastly differentiated by country. Just as wealthier and poorer citizens reside at different technological levels, so do wealthier and poorer countries.\nA few countries have already established themselves as leading robot societies. About 70 percent of total robot sales take place in Japan, China, the United States, South Korea, and Germany\u2014known as the \u201cbig five\u201d in robotics. Japan, the United States, and Germany dominate the landscape in high-value industrial and medical robots, and South Korea and China are major producers of less expensive consumer-oriented robots. While Japan records the highest number of robot sales, China represents the most rapidly growing market, with sales increasing by 25 percent every year since 2005.\nThere is quite a gap between the big five and the rest of the world. As both consumers and producers of robots, these countries outpace all others. By way of illustration, the number of industrial robots produced in South Korea, a country of 50 million people, is several times greater than the number produced in South America, Central America, Africa, and India combined, with populations totaling 2.8 billion. Russia is effectively a nonplayer in robotics despite its industrial base. It neither produces nor buys robots to any significant degree, instead maintaining extractive industries (natural gas, oil, iron, nickel) and industrial manufacturing plants that look and function the way they did in the 1970s and 1980s.\nRobots will be the rare technology that reaches the mainstream through elderly users first, spreading down as grandma shows off her next cutting-edge gadget for the kids and grandkids.\nThe big five\u2019s comparative advantage might even accelerate in the future, for these are the same countries that are most likely to incorporate the next generation of robotics into society, work, and home. They will own the name brands in consumer robots, and they\u2019ll power the software and networks that enable the robotics ecosystem. When I think about this symbiosis, I think about the Internet in the 1990s. It was not just the consumer-facing Internet companies that were born and based in Silicon Valley; it was also the network equipment makers like Cisco Systems and Juniper Networks. Today Cisco and Juniper have a combined 85,000 employees and $154 billion in market value. The same types of back-end systems will exist in the robotics industry. And the big five countries will benefit from being home to the high-paying jobs and wealth accumulation that go with being out ahead of the 191 other countries around the world. They will produce the Ciscos and Junipers of robotics.\nInterestingly, less developed countries might be able to leapfrog technologies as they enter the robot landscape. Countries in Africa and Central Asia have been able to go straight to cell phones without building landline telephones, and in the same way they might be able to jump ahead in robotics without having to establish an advanced industrial base.\nThe African Robotics Network (AFRON) offers a good model. A community of individuals and institutions, AFRON hosts events and projects to boost robotics-related education, research, and industry on the continent. Through initiatives like its 10 Dollar Robot Challenge, AFRON encourages the development of extremely low-cost robotics education. One winner was RoboArm, a project from Obafemi Awolowo University in Nigeria whose armlike structure is made out of plastic and runs on scavenged motors. The ability to generate low-cost innovation based on scarcity of materials is rooted in the concept of frugal innovation.\nAs robotics starts to spread, the degree to which countries can succeed in the robot era will depend in part on culture\u2014on how readily people accept robots into their lives. Western and Eastern cultures are highly differentiated in how they view robots. Not only does Japan have an economic need and the technological know-how for robots, but it also has a cultural predisposition. The ancient Shinto religion, practiced by 80 percent of Japanese, includes a belief in animism, which holds that both objects and human beings have spirits. As a result, Japanese culture tends to be more accepting of robot companions as actual companions than is Western culture, which views robots as soulless machines. In a culture where the inanimate can be considered to be just as alive as the animate, robots can be seen as members of society rather than as mere tools or as threats.\nIn contrast, fears of robotics are deeply seated in Western culture. The threat of humanity creating things we cannot control pervades Western literature, leaving a long history of cautionary tales. Prometheus was condemned to an eternity of punishment for giving fire to humans. When Icarus flew too high, the sun melted his ingenious waxed wings and he fell to his death. In Mary Shelley\u2019s Frankenstein, Dr. Frankenstein\u2019s grotesque creation wreaks havoc and ultimately leads to its creator\u2019s death\u2014and numerous B-movie remakes.\nThis fear does not pervade Eastern culture to the same extent. The cultural dynamic in Japan is representative of the culture through much of East Asia, enabling the Asian robotics industry to speed ahead, unencumbered by cultural baggage. Investment in robots reflects a cultural comfort with robots, and, in China, departments of automation are well represented and well respected in the academy. There are more than 100 automation departments in Chinese universities, compared with approximately 76 in the United States despite the larger total number of universities in the United States.\nIn South Korea, teaching robots are seen in a positive light; in Europe, they are viewed negatively. As with eldercare, in Europe robots are seen as machines, whereas in Asia they are viewed as potential companions. In the United States, the question is largely avoided because of an immigration system that facilitates the entry of new, low-cost labor that often ends up in fields that might otherwise turn to service robots. In the other parts of the world, attitudes often split the difference. A recent study in the Middle East showed that people would be open to a humanoid household-cleaning robot but not to robots that perform more intimate and influential roles such as teaching. The combination of cultural, demographic, and technological factors means that we will get our first glimpse of a world full of robots in East Asia.\nHUMANIZING ROBOTS\nThe first wave of labor substitution from automation and robotics came from jobs that were often dangerous, dirty, and dreary and involved little personal interaction, but increasingly, robots are encroaching on jobs in the service sector that require personalized skills. Jobs in the service sector that were largely immune from job loss during the last stage of globalization are now at risk because advances in robotics have accelerated in recent years, due to breakthroughs in the field itself as well as new advancements in information management, computing, and high-end engineering. Tasks once thought the exclusive domain of humans\u2014the types of jobs that require situational awareness, spatial reasoning and dexterity, contextual understanding, and human judgment\u2014are opening up to robots.\nTwo key developments have dovetailed to make this possible: improvements in modeling belief space and the uplink of robots to the cloud. Belief space refers to a mathematical framework that allows us to model a given environment statistically and develop probabilistic outcomes. It is basically the application of algorithms to make sense of new or messy contexts. For robots, modeling belief space opens the way for greater situational awareness. It has led to breakthroughs in areas like grasping, once a difficult robot task. Until recently belief space was far too complex to sufficiently compute, a task made all the more difficult by the limited sets of robot experience available to analyze. But advances in data analytics have combined with exponentially greater sets of experiential robot data to enable programmers to develop robots that can now intelligently interact with their environment.\nThe recent exponential growth of robot data is due largely to the development of cloud robotics, a term coined by Google researcher James Kuffner in 2010. Linked to the cloud, robots can access vast troves of data and shared experience to enhance the understanding of their own belief space. Before being hooked up to the cloud, robots had access to very limited data\u2014either their own experience or that of a narrow cluster of robots. They were stand-alone pieces of electronics with capabilities that were limited to the hardware and software inside the unit. But by becoming networked devices, constantly connected to the cloud, robots can now incorporate the experiences of every other robot of their kind, \u201clearning\u201d at an accelerating rate.\nImagine the kind of quantum leap that human culture would undertake if we were all suddenly given a direct link to the knowledge and experience of everyone else on the planet\u2014if, when we made a decision, we were drawing from not just our own limited experience and expertise but from that of billions of other people. Big data has enabled this quantum leap for the cognitive development of robots.\nWith a connection to the cloud, robots can now incorporate the experiences of every other robot of their kind, \u201clearning\u201d at an accelerating rate.\nAnother major development in robotics arrives through materials science, which has allowed robots to be constructed of new materials. Robots no longer have to be cased in the aluminum bodies of armor that characterized C-3PO or R2-D2. Today\u2019s robots can have bodies made of silicone, or even spider silk, that are eerily natural looking. Highly flexible components\u2014such as air muscles (which distribute power through tubes holding highly concentrated pressurized air), electroactive polymers (which change a robot\u2019s size and shape when stimulated by an electric field), and ferrofluids (basically magnetic fluids that facilitate more humanlike movement)\u2014have created robots that you might not even recognize as being artificial, almost like the Arnold Schwarzenegger cyborg in The Terminator. An imitation caterpillar robot designed by researchers at Tufts University to perform tasks as varied as finding land mines and diagnosing diseases is even biodegradable\u2014just like us.\nRobots are now also being built both bigger and smaller than ever before. Nanorobots, still in the early phases of development, promise a future in which autonomous machines at the scale of 10-9 meters (far, far smaller than a grain of sand) can diagnose and treat human diseases at the cellular level. On the other end of the spectrum, the world\u2019s largest walking robot is a German-made fire-breathing dragon that stands at 51 feet long, weighs 11 tons, and is filled with more than 20 gallons of stage blood. Apparently the Germans have a festival involving it.\nRecent advances will continue. It is not just Japan\u2019s government that is devoting ever-increasing resources to robotics. In the United States, President Obama launched the National Robotics Initiative in 2011 to stimulate development of robots for industrial automation, elder assistance, and military applications. Run by the National Science Foundation, the program has awarded more than $100 million in contracts. France has initiated a similar program, pledging $126.9 million to develop its industry and catch up to Germany. Sweden has similarly earmarked millions to give out to individuals and corporations through innovation awards such as Robotdalen (\u201crobot valley\u201d), launched in 2011.\nThe field of robotics is very much like where the world stood with the Internet 20 years ago. We are at the beginning of something: chapter one, page one.\nThe private sector is also investing at increasingly higher levels. Google purchased Boston Dynamics, a leading robotics design company with Pentagon contracts, for an untold sum in December 2013. It also bought DeepMind, a London-based artificial intelligence company founded by wunderkind Demis Hassabis. As a kid, Hassabis was the second-highest-ranked chess player in the world under the age of 14, and while he was getting his PhD in cognitive neuroscience, he was acknowledged by Science magazine for making one of the ten most important science breakthroughs of the year after developing a new biological theory for how imagination and memory work in the brain.\nAt DeepMind, Demis and his colleagues effectively created the computer equivalent of hand-eye coordination, something that had never been accomplished before in robotics. In a demo, Demis showed me how he had taught his computers how to play old Atari 2600 video games in the same way that humans play them, based on looking at a screen and adjusting actions through neural processes responding to an opponent\u2019s actions. He\u2019d taught computers how to think in much the way that humans do. Then Google bought DeepMind for half a billion dollars and is applying its expertise in machine learning and systems neuroscience to power the algorithms it is developing as it expands beyond Internet search and further into robotics.\nMost corporate research and development in robotics comes from within big companies (like Google, Toyota, and Honda), but venture capital funding in robotics is growing at a steep rate. It more than doubled in just three years, from $160 million in 2011 to $341 million in 2014. In its first year of investment, Grishin Robotics, a $25 million seed investment fund, evaluated more than 600 start-ups before coming to terms with the eight now in its portfolio. Singulariteam, a new Israeli venture capital fund, quickly raised two funds of $100 million each to invest in early-stage robotics and artificial intelligence. The appeal for investors is obvious: the market for consumer robots could hit $390 billion by 2017, and industrial robots should hit $40 billion in 2020.\nAs the technology continues to improve, there is an ongoing debate about just how radically human life will be transformed by advanced robots and whether robots will ultimately surpass us. One view in the debate is that it\u2019s inevitable robots will pass us; another is that they can\u2019t possibly compete with us; a third is that man and machine could merge. Within the robotics community, the future of technology is wrapped up in the concept of singularity, the theoretical point in time when artificial intelligence will match or surpass human intelligence. If singularity is achieved, it is unclear what the relationship between robots and humans will become. (In the Terminator series, once singularity is achieved, a self-aware computer system decides to launch a war on humans.)\nEnthusiasts for the singularity imagine that investments in robotics will do more than strengthen corporate balance sheets; they will radically enhance human well-being, eliminating mundane tasks and replacing diseased or aging parts of our bodies. The technology community is deeply divided about whether singularity is a good thing or a bad thing, with one camp believing it will enhance human experience as another camp, equally large, believes it will unleash a dystopian future where people become subservient to machines.\nBut will singularity occur?\nThose who believe that singularity will be achieved point to several key factors. First, they argue that Moore\u2019s law, which holds that the amount of computing power we can fit into a chip will double every two years, shows little sign of slowing down. Moore\u2019s law applies to the transistors and technology that control robots as well as those in computers. Add rapid advances in machine learning, data analytics, and cloud robotics, and it\u2019s clear that computing is going to keep rapidly improving. Those who argue for the singularity differ on when it will occur. Mathematician Vernor Vinge predicts that it will occur by 2023; futurist Ray Kurzweil says 2045. But the question looming over singularity is whether there\u2019s a limit on how far our technology can ultimately go.\nThose who argue against the possibility of singularity point to several factors. The software advances necessary to reach singularity demand a detailed scientific understanding of the human brain, but our lack of understanding about the basic neural structure of the brain impedes software development. Moreover, while weak artificial intelligence, whereby robots simply specialize in a specific function, is currently advancing exponentially, strong artificial intelligence, whereby robots demonstrate humanlike cognition and intelligence, is advancing only linearly. While inventions like IBM\u2019s Watson (the computer designed by IBM that beat Jeopardy! champions Ken Jennings and Brad Rutter) are exciting, scientists need a better understanding of the brain before these advances progress beyond winning a game show. Watson didn\u2019t actually \u201cthink\u201d; it was basically a very comprehensive search engine querying a large database. As robotics expert and UC Berkeley professor Ken Goldberg explains, \u201cRobots are going to become increasingly human. But the gap between humans and robots will remain\u2014it\u2019s so large that it will be with us for the foreseeable future.\u201d\nIt\u2019s my view that the current moment in the field of robotics is very much like where the world stood with the Internet 20 years ago. We are at the beginning of something: chapter one, page one. Just as it would have been difficult in the days of dial-up modems to imagine an Internet video service like YouTube streaming over 6 billion hours of video every month, it is difficult for us to imagine today that lifelike robots may walk the streets with us, work in the cubicle next to ours, or take our elderly parents for a walk and then help them with dinner.\nThis is not happening today and it will not happen tomorrow, but it will happen during most of our lifetimes. The level of investment in robotics, combined with advances in big data, network technologies, materials science, and artificial intelligence, are setting the foundation for the 2020s to produce breakthroughs in robotics that bring today\u2019s science fiction right into mainstream use.\nAlec Ross is the New York Times bestselling author of The Industries of the Future, recently released by Simon & Schuster.

They want Apple to hack its own product by building an entirely new version of its iOS software and they want it to deliberately have security holes and weakened encryption so that the FBI can access the data on iPhones. \nIf Apple does this, then the idea that only the FBI will be able to exploit this new vulnerability is na\u00efve. By mandating that companies undermine their own encryption, it opens vulnerabilities that weaken the integrity of security systems for everyone.\nIf a backdoor is built for the FBI, then I believe that the door is also open for the Chinese, the Russians, and for non-state based hackers to enter, too.\nWhat\u2019s more, if US policy requires mandatory assistance from companies to break encryption, it is certain that other countries will demand the same on the same precedent.  And unlike the United States, their motives will not necessarily be bound by the rule of law.  This puts American companies in an impossible position. \nThe FBI is not acting with malignant intent. This is no longer J. Edgar Hoover\u2019s FBI. However, by trying to solve a short-term problem (accessing the contents of a single terrorist\u2019s iPhone) they are creating a much bigger, long-term problem: opening access to once secure systems.\nAs more of our life is connected to the cloud, the idea that mandatory backdoors are built-in is a nightmare. In my book The Industries of the Future, I argue that as we store things like our medical records to the cloud, that we must make sure those systems are encrypted and secure. This means no mandatory backdoors. \nFor these reasons and others, intelligence agencies including the NSA and GCHQ have come out clearly in favor of strong encryption with no backdoors. Law enforcement has other methods to get access to data other than mandating decryption. \nFor all of our security, let\u2019s hope that Apple prevails on this issue and the FBI does not.\nAlec Ross is the author of The Industries of the Future, recently released by Simon & Schuster."}, {"author": "Alec Ross", "headline": "Silicon Valley dominated the world for 20 years. Who wins in the next 20 years, though, is still a very big question.", "body": "\u201cWe want to create our own Silicon Valley.\u201d\nIf there\u2019s a single sentence I\u2019ve heard in every country I\u2019ve been to, it\u2019s this one. Silicon Valley has been home to technology-driven innovation for a long time, but the 20-year period from 1994 to 2014 was something special.\nPeople all over the world witnessed a spectacular level of innovation and wealth creation, all emerging from a small 30-mile long, 15-mile-wide strip of Northern California. Other states and countries have been attempting to build the \u201cnext Silicon Valley\u201d for years now. At this point, there\u2019s even a formula.\nAs Marc Andreessen writes:\nThe popular recipe for creating the \u201cnext\u201d Silicon Valley goes something like this:\nBuild a big, beautiful, fully equipped technology park;\nMix in R&D labs and university centers;\nProvide incentives to attract scientists, firms and users;\nInterconnect the industry through consortia and specialized suppliers;\nProtect intellectual property and tech transfer;\nEstablish a favorable business environment and regulations.\nIt happens all the time all over the world. And it never works.\nWhen I\u2019m asked, \u201cWhat can we do to create our own Silicon Valley?\u201d my response surprises many people: \u201cYou can\u2019t,\u201d I say. \u201cIt\u2019s too late. Silicon Valley has a decades-long head start creating the perfect environment for creating Internet businesses. What you can do, though, is position your communities to compete and succeed in those areas of innovation that are still to come.\u201d\nThe development of fields such as genomics, robotics, and cyber will all benefit from the interventions that Andreessen listed. But for cities or countries seeking to create the next hotbed for any of these fields, there are also broader factors to consider.\nBuilding an innovation-rich place like Silicon Valley requires specific cultural and labor-market characteristics that can contradict both a society\u2019s norms and the more controlling impulses of government leaders. \nA critical factor: domain expertise\nWith the industries of the future \u2014 a topic I researched extensively as part of my new book \u2014 new avenues of opportunity for countries and people alike will hinge on domain expertise: deep knowledge about a single industry, which tends to concentrate in specific cities or regions. Detroit has domain expertise in cars, Paris has it in fashion, and Silicon Valley has it in Internet-based businesses.\nDomain expertise for the industries of the future is still broadly distributed. To understand domain expertise, consider the following question: Why do a ridiculously high percentage of Internet companies still come out of Silicon Valley when massive investment is being made around the world to compete with it? Many factors are at play, but domain expertise is the most important.\nFor more than 20 years, the world\u2019s best computer scientists have overwhelmingly been based in Silicon Valley. They could have been born anywhere, but they came to Silicon Valley for school (Stanford or Berkeley), employment (which creates a self-reinforcing cycle that concentrates talent), and investment (with the Valley offering far and away the most access to early-stage capital in the world). And they came to be included in a culture and community that placed the computer science engineer at the highest level of social status.\nThe Valley came to be not just any old industrial center, but a kind of beacon\u2014a place that promised not just opportunity but a sense of belonging\u2014and that continues to attract wave after wave of ambitious entrepreneurs. But nothing like that exists yet for the industries of the future, where the most interesting and important innovations are taking place with greater geographic spread than we see with Internet-based innovation.\nThere are early geographic leaders in each of the fields, but it is still far too early to describe any of these as the winners or losers in the competition to be home to the next generation of innovation. And what concentration there is today is not destined to be permanent.\nIn the current landscape, the most important work in the commercialization of genomics is clustered around universities where much of the original research and development took place. It is in and around Boston because of Harvard and MIT, Baltimore because of Johns Hopkins, and Silicon Valley because of Stanford and the Universities of California in San Francisco and Berkeley. Walking through the offices of these companies, one can\u2019t help but notice how diverse the workforces are. European, Asian, African, and South American employees fill these companies and live in Boston, Baltimore, or California because they all studied at American universities.\nThe other major prong of genetics research is in China. Though it does not have a top university program in genetics, China has done an excellent job recruiting its citizens back home after they have studied abroad. As a result, Beijing is quickly becoming a center of domain expertise in genomics. In cyber, the most interesting companies are often based proximate to government, where domain expertise was developed inside the best law enforcement and intelligence communities, including Washington, D.C., Tel Aviv, London, and Moscow. Europe\u2019s first cybersecurity accelerator, CyLon, was cofounded by two top foreign policy aides to British prime ministers. One of the world\u2019s largest cybersecurity companies, Kaspersky Lab, is full of former Russian military and intelligence officers.\nIsrael has many of the best cybersecurity firms, founded by people who got their start in cyber in the Israeli Defense Forces, especially Unit 8200, Yehida Shmoneh-Matayim, the intelligence corps focused on signals intelligence.\nIn robotics, domain expertise and the early commercial leadership is generally concentrated where there is preexisting domain expertise in electronics and advanced manufacturing\u2014in countries like Japan, South Korea, and Germany. Yet even as the industries of the future offer new opportunities to rising hotbeds of innovation around the world, it\u2019s interesting to watch how Silicon Valley\u2019s influence lingers and continues to draw start-ups in almost every industry. Consider the example of digital currency and fintech, industries of the future that blend old world and new.\nNew York and London are the world\u2019s two dominant centers of domain expertise in global banking today, and both are home to substantial fintech investment. Over the past five years, the United Kingdom and Ireland were home to 52 percent of all the fintech financing in Europe. And New York drew even larger levels of fintech financing than London, with dozens of deals putting hundreds of millions of dollars into the bank accounts of technology companies trying to make the banking sector smarter.\nBut when Zac Townsend wanted to start a company focused on smartening up the banking industry, he did not start it in London or New York. He started it in California. It mattered less to Zac that expertise in banking specifically was in New York or London than that the expertise in innovation and its supporting culture was in California. He believed that in order to change the banking system, he had to work with it but away from it\u2014an approach that is also reflected in the broader data.\nAlthough New York and London are the global centers for banking, they are respectively second and third in fintech financing behind Silicon Valley, which gets about one-third of all the investments that take place in the fintech space. This raises an interesting question about just how distributed the industries of the future are going to be.\nSilicon Valley: the next Roman empire?\nWhen twentysomethings like Zac decide to start a company and determine that in order to do so they need to be in California, it creates a self-perpetuating cycle. More broadly, Zac\u2019s decision to base his new data-driven finance company in Silicon Valley reflects a roiling debate over just how domain expertise will develop in the big data industry and what effect this is going to have on the global economy as a whole. With the major impact that big data is having on almost every industry, the way that big data expertise develops has the potential to change the very nature of business. And investors are placing big bets on two very different answers.\nWill big data serve to centralize businesses, pulling more industries into the gravitational field of Silicon Valley? Or will it allow more businesses to innovate wherever they are, in effect creating more opportunities in more places around the world than has been possible before now?\nOn one side of the argument is Charlie Songhurst, who sees the Valley as a burgeoning global empire. Because of Silicon Valley, Charlie says, \u201cGlobal regional inequality is going to be unlike anything we\u2019ve ever seen except maybe the comparative power of Rome versus the rest of the ancient world.\u201d While I think Charlie overstates things, he makes an argument that\u2019s worth examining.\nHis thesis lines up with a number of other thinkers who believe that Silicon Valley\u2019s expertise in software and analytics will swallow up entire industries and cause massive centralization. The founders of Uber had no particular expertise in transportation, but that did not matter because of their ability to build a software and analytics platform. The idea that underlies Songhurst\u2019s vision is that Silicon Valley companies could eventually run everything in which software and big data are useful\u2014which is basically every industry on the planet. So what\u2019s going to happen in this new data-driven empire, according to Charlie? \u201cIt\u2019s a very simple equation,\u201d he says. \u201cCountries with high education and low wages will export IQ. That will be the Baltics, India, China. Of course, it\u2019s terrible if you\u2019re in Ohio or England or France or someone competing with an Estonian. So what you\u2019ll get is a massive mean reversion of income throughout the world where the Valley, Israel, China, and maybe a couple of other places get very high economic returns and everywhere else in the world starts to revert to the mean. Again, it starts to look more like the Roman Empire.\u201d\nIt is also the case that while the powers that be in Silicon Valley might not be the earliest movers in fields like precision agriculture, once success is achieved elsewhere, they don\u2019t just sit back as passive bystanders and watch it grow. Google chairman Eric Schmidt recruited an Israeli entrepreneur, Dror Berman, to move to Silicon Valley and head up Innovation Endeavors, a large venture firm that invests Schmidt\u2019s money. Israel is home to many of the 20th century\u2019s great innovations in farming. Berman brought the intellectual curiosity about agriculture with him to Silicon Valley and developed Farm2050, a partnership that aspires to combine data science and robotics to improve farming with a group of partners as diverse as Google, DuPont, and 3D Robotics.\nDror recognized that Silicon Valley can be a little too navel-gazing, and told me that 90 percent of the region\u2019s entrepreneurs focus on 10 percent of the world\u2019s problems. With Farm2050, he is trying to bring Silicon Valley\u2019s A game to agriculture. Silicon Valley\u2019s history as a home to apricot and plum orchards is long past, and if it does establish itself as the source of winning investment or innovation for precision agriculture, it will contradict the idea that domain expertise will drive the industries of the future. Instead, it would suggest, as futurist Jaron Lanier has argued in his book Who Owns the Future?, that those who hold the most data, the fastest servers, and the most processing power will drive all growth from here on out.\nIt\u2019s basically the idea that Google could do my job and your job\u2014 and everyone else\u2019s job\u2014better if they wanted to simply by applying their top-of-the-line analytics abilities. There is an increasingly large audience, however, that holds a different view from Charlie Songhurst. They believe that big data, instead of absorbing and supplanting other industries, will serve as a broad tool that every existing industry can use to spur growth. The idea is that data will become widely usable and scalable enough that it won\u2019t have domain expertise in the same way that other high-barrier-to-entry industries of the future like genomics or robotics do.\nThis view was explained to me by Mark Gorenberg, a veteran of West Coast venture investing who saw the investment case for analytics early and built a venture capital firm around it, Zetta Venture Partners. Mark has been in venture capital for a quarter-century and splits most of his time among investing, work with MIT, and serving as an advisor to the president of the United States as a member of the President\u2019s Council of Advisors on Science and Technology. Gorenberg believes the big data economy will extend far beyond Silicon Valley.\nHe says: \u201cAnalytics businesses will come from anywhere. You have the algorithmic expertise on one side that is coming out of a lot of universities and you have the domain expertise for particular industries, which manifest themselves everywhere.\u201d Gorenberg argues that as the big data market grows over the next couple of decades, it can be a source of revitalization for old industrial centers where local domain expertise exists.\nIn the rust belt, for example, he sees strong opportunities for the development of analytics firms rooted in the region\u2019s strength managing industrial processes. He sees Boston\u2019s strength as a biotech center enabling it to create health data companies, and he foresees the creation of energy analytics companies in Texas. He predicts that we will see strong privacy and forensics companies forming around Washington, D.C., that build on the capabilities in the law enforcement and intelligence communities, providing high-paying jobs for people who worked at the NSA, CIA, and FBI.\nIf Gorenberg is correct that \u201cdomain expertise is everywhere,\u201d then there is no reason not to be optimistic about the prospects for big data firms developing outside the United States. It just takes a combination of algorithmic expertise and domain expertise.\nFor example, having lost out on the wealth creation built around the Internet, Germany is now determined to leverage its domain expertise in logistics and household appliances to own the analytics markets in those areas of traditional strength, an initiative it calls Industrie 4.0. If the big data market develops as Gorenberg predicts\u2014with the best companies being headquartered all over the world\u2014then wealth creation will look entirely different for big data than it did for the Internet, where the benefits were concentrated in a 30-by-15- mile area.\nI was persuaded by Gorenberg\u2019s view when I was in New Zealand and saw an example of how the combination of big data and domain expertise will determine the geography of the industries of the future. New Zealand is home to twice as many dairy cattle as human beings. The Kiwis know cows.\nWhile there, I learned about the impact of Pasture Meter, a precision-agriculture technology developed in Palmerston, a community of 82,000 people in the Manawatu-Wanganui region of New Zealand\u2019s North Island, more than 10,000 kilometers away from Silicon Valley. Pasture Meter uses advanced sensor technology to take 200 measurements per second over vast swaths of farmland to identify how much grass is in a paddock so that dairy cows can be distributed most effectively for feeding. It alerts farmers to the amount of feed they have and identifies low-production areas that need intervention from the farmer, say, more fertilizer.\nTraditional technology for evaluating fields, like ultrasound or rising plate meters, typically captures only 250 readings of a pasture, whereas Pasture Meter can take up to 18,500 readings. Anyone with a phone can use the technology, and it works regardless of factors like weather.\nIt may seem that monitoring pastures\u2014literally watching the grass grow\u2014is an unnecessary use of real-time analytics, but the Kiwi farmers know better. With the massive increase in upward economic mobility in China, there was increasing demand for beef and dairy products, but New Zealand\u2019s cattle farmers needed higher levels of efficiency\u2014greater scale and lower prices\u2014if they were going to sell into such a large market.\nChina\u2019s population is 288 times the size of New Zealand\u2019s. With strong domain expertise in dairy farming, local farmers and farm-equipment manufacturers knew that if they could feed their cattle more efficiently, that would increase output enough for them to export to China. What happened? Sales of beef from New Zealand to China soared 478 percent in one year. China surpassed New Zealand\u2019s neighbor Australia as New Zealand\u2019s largest export market, more than twice the size of what is exported from New Zealand to the United States.\nThe fact that it surprised me that it could be so important to know the location and concentration of grass in a field is exactly the point: New Zealand\u2019s farmers had the domain expertise, so they knew what needed to be built and they built it. It\u2019s too much to say that Pasture Meter deserves credit for the full 478 percent increase in beef exports, but local farmers bring it up as one of the important factors.\nWhat happened in New Zealand can and will happen in other industries where there may not be a deep history of big data and analytics, but where there is domain expertise in another industry that knows where and how analytics would add value. The big data applications themselves are easily scalable, can be done broadly around the world, and can be implemented whether or not there is much previous data experience\u2014as was the case for the people in Palmerston, New Zealand, who made equipment for the region\u2019s dairy farmers.\nSilicon Valley builds things that Silicon Valley wants, from nicer taxi services to more photo-sharing apps. But investors and entrepreneurs in Silicon Valley don\u2019t see the world through, say, the eyes of farmers. Thus, they are less likely than a company in the Manawatu Wanganui region of New Zealand\u2019s North Island to recognize the need for and develop a technology that enables greater beef and dairy production for export to China. While Marc Andreessen is as closely identified with Silicon Valley as anybody, he agrees that those fields that are early in their development can and should take root wherever there is deep knowledge about a specific area.\nHe has proposed that Detroit leverage its expertise in automotive mechanics to become \u201cDrone Valley,\u201d and suggests that rather than trying to create more Silicon Valleys, we should hope and plan for the creation of \u201c50 different variations of Silicon Valley, all unique from each other and all focusing on different domains.\u201d\nLarry Summers reinforced Andreessen\u2019s view, telling me, \u201cMy general line is, in essence, there is much more division of labor than there used to be. Strategies for countries, companies, and people are much more about building on your strength than offsetting your weaknesses than it used to be.\u201d\nThis effectively means to stop trying to chase after Silicon Valley and focus on the skills and processes that will unleash the next wave of innovation in fields in which there is already local expertise. My view is that the geographic spread of domain expertise in the industries of the future will ensure that the next stage of globalization produces centers of innovation and commercialization that are more geographically diverse than the last stage, when Silicon Valley enjoyed 20 years of domination.\nThere won\u2019t be a Roman Empire. The thought that software and big data\u2013savvy companies and entrepreneurs in Silicon Valley will reign supreme is not a crazy one, but I think that as big data becomes more widely adopted, it will be more of a commodity that any industry can use. There is a real opportunity for stakeholders with domain expertise to innovate for themselves, and in breathtaking ways.\nBut if they wait too long, some 28-year-olds in California are going to do it instead.\nIn the cases where an industry is too slow to adapt, then eventually more efficient, less expert start-ups (with big data expertise) like Uber will step in and take down companies with decades of domain expertise.\nIn the famous words of H. G. Wells, \u201cAdapt or perish.\u201d\nAlec Ross is the author of The Industries of the Future, to be released next week by Simon & Schuster.

Their answers?", "body": "During two years of intense research for the writing The Industries of the Future, my interviews with dozens of the world\u2019s most successful, powerful people often turned to parenting. We\u2019ve heard people like Carlos Slim, Eric Schmidt and Larry Summers talk about business or the economy, but talking to them about what skills and attributes today\u2019s children will need to compete and succeed in tomorrow\u2019s economy always got them far away from talking points. \nWhile I dedicate an entire chapter to the topic of parenting in The Industries of the Future, I did want to briefly share some common themes that emerged from my research.\n1. Make sure your kids are learning languages, foreign languages as well as a technical, programming, or scientific language. If big data, genomics, cyber, and robotics/AI are among the high-growth industries of the future, then the people who will make their livings in those industries need to be fluent in the coding languages behind them. Coding also teaches children a way to think and solve problems that is still valuable even if the computer programming language changes.\nSimilarly, as the economy grows more global, cultural fluency and the ability to communicate in more than just one language will grow even more important than they are today.\n2. Demand more academic enrichment out of your children\u2019s schools, but don\u2019t rely on them. My mother was nicknamed Becky the Barbarian in part because she was a relentless advocate for her children\u2019s education at school and at home. I did not appreciate it at the time, but that is what enabled a public school kid from West Virginia who had to work as a midnight janitor to achieve the success I have since had in business, government and academia.\nThe business leaders I spoke with suggested we all needed to follow the Becky the Barbarian model. Hold others to account but also hold yourself to account. Do something about it if your school isn\u2019t offering a rigorous education that meets your child\u2019s needs, but also do something about it if the hours after school for your children are spent unproductively. If your child\u2019s school does not teach them a foreign language, computer programming or challenging enough math, there are enough free resources online that you don\u2019t have an excuse as a parent to keep that from your children.\n3. Ingrain your children with a commitment to lifelong learning. The idea that education ends with an undergraduate or graduate university degree is an anachronism. That MBA or masters in electrical engineering that is so difficult to earn will be near-useless 15 years after graduation if there isn\u2019t a commitment to continuing to learn. The pace of change in business has quickened over the past 10 years and is only going to accelerate further. It\u2019s not the strongest who survive, or the most intelligent, but those most adaptable to change. Lifelong learners are the more resilient than anybody else in times of change.\nI\u2019ll conclude by stating the obvious: these three things are not meant to be comprehensive, nor do they account for social, emotional and spiritual development. But in discussions with many of the world\u2019s most successful people in business, these stand-out. Please share what you think are the key attributes today\u2019s children will need to be successful in tomorrow\u2019s economy!\nAlec Ross is the author of The Industries of the Future, to be released in February by Simon & Schuster."}, {"author": "Alec Ross", "headline": "China has a decision to make in 2016, and it's one that matters for the global economy", "body": "It\u2019s a rainy, smoggy day here in Shanghai\u2019s Pudong District.

The bars are full of hard-drinking traders and investors.\nPeople in the United States and Europe checking their portfolio and wondering why their stocks are getting hammered should know that this is all a part of what is happening over here. \n2016 is China\u2019s year of reckoning, as it addresses long-overdue capital market reforms including bringing market reality to the value of its long-inflated currency, the renminbi. \nBehind the macroeconomics is a choice China has to make: does it grow by opening up its country to greater transparency, accountability and playing by global rules, or does it play by its own rules and keep its markets relatively closed and bank on the fact that they can set the conditions for anybody hoping to do business here and access its consumer market of 1.3 billion people.\nSo far, its response has been schizophrenic. On the positive side, the reforms it announced last year allowing for more truth in the value of its currency and interest rates were responsible steps forward. The crackdown against corruption continues, too. Among those who reportedly have been detained in the last few weeks are the chairman of China\u2019s largest private conglomerate and the head of one of its largest fashion companies, estimated to be China\u2019s 34th and 65th richest citizens respectively (by way of companies, Forbes estimates Elon Musk and Eli Broad to be America\u2019s 34th and 65th richest).\nOn the negative side, there are abundant other examples that China is reasserting its control-freak impulses. Last week, the Chinese central bank temporarily suspended certain foreign banks from conducting foreign exchange transactions.\nThe impulse for control continues to reach from central markets to deep into peoples\u2019 personal lives.

If it opens up, it will position itself to better compete in the industries of the future. The devaluation of its currency and unwinding of its old systems will cause short-term economic distress, but it will be worth it. If it tightens up by slowing its reforms and continuing to crack down on free speech and journalism, its growth will slow down further, and there will be more rainy days in Shanghai.\nAlec Ross is the author of The Industries of the Future, to be released in February by Simon & Schuster."}, {"author": "Alec Ross", "headline": "I've traveled the globe, and I'm convinced that these are the cities we'll all want to watch in 2016", "body": "There are all sorts of lists of the best start-ups regions in the world ranking local ecosystems for innovation and entrepreneurship.

STOCKHOLM \nStockholm, Sweden is a lot more than Spotify. It is now the second largest producer of billion dollar start-ups after Silicon Valley on a per capita basis. The thing that stands out about young Swedish companies is the diversity. They\u2019re producing winners in fields as varied as telecommunications, gaming and the Internet of Things. The entrepreneurs and engineers from all over Sweden (with just 9.5 million people) converge on stylish Stockholm when it comes time to start a company.\nWhile I was in government, I noticed that Sweden\u2019s security-focused computer scientists are some of the best in the world. With people becoming ever-more focused on privacy and security, I expect the some of the high-end research and development being done by Swedish engineers to be commercialized in 2016 and find a market almost immediately.  \n2. CAMBRIDGE (NOT MASSACHUSETTS!) \nCambridge, Massachusetts has long been home to start-ups with intellectual roots at MIT and Harvard. It\u2019s now the university town north of London that has the start-up scene that is ready to achieve altitude. Its \u201cSilicon Fen\u201d has been around for some time, producing modest successes. Some of its analytics and biotech companies are among the most exciting in the world. \nThe best indication to me that the UK\u2019s Cambridge was ready to enter the first tier came from hearing the same thing on more than one phone call with world-leading investors. \nMe: Where are you calling from?\nBig Investor: Um, Cambridge University.\nMe: Nice! What are you doing up there?\nBig Investor: Well, uh, just talking to a couple companies.\n3. SEOUL \nSouth Korea is far-better known for its big electronics and automotive companies than it is for its start-ups, but that could soon change given the new maturity of a start-up scene in Seoul many years in the making.\nThe South Korean government is trying to tailor its regulatory environment to be as entrepreneur-friendly as possible. This includes $3.7 billion of spending by government in its start-ups.\nIts aggressive M&A environment allows for entrepreneurs and investors to achieve liquidity more easily than most other Asian markets and allows successful company founders to start that next company. \nMost important is a change in mindset. Following decades of military dictatorship, the safety of a traditional job in a big company was appealing to most Koreans. \u201cStability\u201d was valued above all else. South Koreans who have grown up in its vibrant democracy and always on youth-culture (to be young and Korean is to be LTE-connected) have an entrepreneurial mindset that is more like their peers across the ocean in California than that of their parents.\n4. MARYLAND \nOkay, I\u2019m cheating on this one. I live in Baltimore so my bias to what\u2019s happening in Maryland could stem from it not requiring time on an airplane. Here\u2019s the thing: Maryland is smack-dab in the middle of two fields that are going to see massive investment and commercialization in 2016: security and genomics. \nTo live in Maryland is to live shoulder-to-shoulder with some of the world\u2019s best mathematicians and computer scientists who work at the NSA, CIA or Beltway contractors that sell to government. More and more of these are abandoning the pension and anonymity lifestyle of career government service to start or join start-ups that are bringing individuals and enterprises intelligence-sector-grade cyber security. The NSA\u2019s cafeteria would be chock-a-block with VCs and headhunters, if only they were allowed on campus. \nMaryland is also home to what might be a better bet for 2017 than 2016: the commercialization of genomics. Billions of dollars of R&D $ flow into projects at the National Institutes of Health and Johns Hopkins University to turn our genetic data into \u201cPrecision Medicines\u201d that can tailor therapies to our genetic make-up. 15 years after the mapping of the human genome, we are almost to the point of mainstreaming Precision Medicines and when that happens, a lot of the innovation will come from scientist-rich Maryland.\nAlec Ross is the author of The Industries of the Future, to be released in February by Simon & Schuster."}, {"author": "Alec Ross", "headline": "Big banks once laughed at Bitcoin. Now, Goldman Sachs wants to use its technology.", "body": "Something happened last week that I think is going to change the course of history for Bitcoin and for financial technology more broadly. \nBitcoin has not supplanted traditional currencies the way that some of its early adopters imagined years ago. An early signal that Bitcoin would be hard-pressed to gain mainstream acceptance came in the form of mudballs that were thrown at it from Wall Street. JP Morgan CEO Jamie Dimon made a comment representative of the sentiment of many of his peers when he said, \u201cthe question isn\u2019t whether we accept it. The question is, do we even participate in people who facilitate Bitcoin.\u201d\nFast forward a few years and Wall Street has discovered that the blockchain technology enabling Bitcoin could save the industry tens of billions a year, so instead of throwing mudballs, they\u2019re now figuring out how to use the technology behind Bitcoin. \nI\u2019ve had two conversations with Goldman Sachs CEO Lloyd Blankfein about Bitcoin. In the first, back in 2013, he sort of sneered. In the second conversation, last year, he half-smiled and said, \u201cwe\u2019re looking at its technology.\u201d \nAt its most basic, a blockchain is a distributed database, a sort of ledger, that is protected with encryption and which allows the transfer of goods and services without middlemen. There are a lot of middlemen in the business of transferring payments.\nEarlier this week, Goldman Sachs filed a patent application for a new virtual currency it calls \u201cSETLcoin\u201d which uses blockchain technology.\nWith SETLcoin, Goldman Sachs imagines instantaneous execution and settlement \u201cfor exchanging assets, such as securities (e.g., stocks, bonds, etc.) cash, and/or cash equivalents via a peer-to-peer network\u201d according to it patent filing, wiping out the costs associated with these types of asset exchanges. \nGoldman isn\u2019t going to start doing business in Bitcoin instead of the dollar, euro or renminbi; it\u2019s taking lessons from Bitcoin and using the blockchain as the computer science protocol for its own cryptocurrency.\nIn the same way HTML became the protocol markup language for the World Wide Web, the blockchain may have the technological ingenuity to become the protocol for transactions where there is a need for a high level of trust.\nI expect Goldman Sachs to do away with one of Bitcoin\u2019s defining features: pseudo-anonymity. By using real names and identities on SETLcoin, Goldman Sachs would near-eliminate the kind of fraud and misuse that has plagued Bitcoin. \nThe cypherpunks and cryptolibertarians behind Bitcoin\u2019s creation and early adoption must be pulling their hair out. Bitcoin was created in the wake of the financial crisis to provide anonymous financial tools as an alternative to the dominant banking system. For Wall Street to now adopt its blockchain technology is deeply ironic and will probably become very, very profitable.\nAlec Ross is the author of The Industries of the Future, to be released in February by Simon & Schuster."}, {"author": "Alec Ross", "headline": "There's a Thanksgiving history lesson we often forget \u2014 but that's never been more relevant", "body": "Happy Thanksgiving! \nIn 1621, a hungry group of migrants who came to America for religious freedom the year before shared a meal with Native Americans from the Wampanoag tribe to give thanks for the pilgrims\u2019 first harvest, after arriving a year earlier with little to eat, too late in the season to grow crops. \nNearly 400 years later, families around the United States including my own will recreate that meal and give thanks for the blessings that life has given us. \nOn this Thanksgiving, I wanted to give thanks that a grandson of immigrants from Italy, Poland, Germany, England and Ukraine lives in a country where I have been able to grow successful and comfortable. \nI had to work for it. When I began my career, it was doing jobs like working as midnight janitor and delivering heavy kegs of beer in rural West Virginia working on a beer truck. Still, unlike many people beginning their careers in most places in the world, my country\u2019s politics and economics gave me a close-to-fair shot at becoming successful. It did not matter that I was the grandchild of migrants. \nIt\u2019s worth mentioning that among the developments for which I\u2019m thankful are tools like LinkedIn that allow people to connect in ways that were unimaginable 10 years ago. When I got that job on a beer truck, it was because the owner of the beer distributorship and my grandfather were both the sons of Italian immigrants, and that personal tie got me a job that I otherwise would not have gotten. \nTools like LinkedIn are creating more open marketplaces for work, and making labor less rooted in biology (who is your dad?) or sociology (which country club do you belong to?). Biology and sociology still matter, but the openness fostered by today\u2019s technology platforms make biology and sociology a little less deterministic. \nI hope that Americans gathered around the Thanksgiving dinner table remember that unless you are part of the less than 1% of Native Americans who make up our population today, that you are a descendent of immigrants. And while you, too, might have grown successful or (relatively) comfortable, there are many people in the world who need demonstrations of compassion like what the Wampanoag showed the pilgrims, teaching them how to farm and hunt in the new world. For hundreds of years, America has been made itself home to waves of migrants from England to Germany, Poland, Ireland, Italy, China, Vietnam, Cambodia, Mexico and dozens of other countries around the world who have fled poverty or political oppression.

And I had received some memorable invitations in the past, such as last year\u2019s invitation from Mrs. Michelle Obama to join her and President Obama at the White House to celebrate Iranian New Year (Norouz) as one of our nation\u2019s Iranian-American thought leaders.\nThe invitation to join Berkeley\u2019s commencement is special to me for two primary reasons:\n1) This past spring was my first time teaching. I had the opportunity of teaching the Product Management course, which I had designed from scratch, to the MBA students at Haas School of Business, UC Berkeley. Now, watching my students walk down the stage, proud to complete their higher education degree from such a fine institution, feels rewarding and satisfactory.\n2) It was only 11 years ago that I myself walked the same stage, graduated from UC Berkeley as an undergraduate. I once again can feel the exuberance I experienced that day. As a first member of my family immigrated to the United States and barely spoke any English at that point, graduating from UC Berkeley was out of realm of possibilities. But I did it! I did it with lots of hard work and struggles. I did it because I didn't let myself believe that limitations could hold me back. My mentality was to solve issues and remove hurdles rather than give in to them.  \nAfter graduation, I had no idea what I would end up doing in my life in the years to come. I surely had no idea which institutions I would end up joining next (Harvard, Fitbit, AthenaHealth, etc), what amazing people I would end up working with and what kinds of personal and professional challenges I would face along the way. As one of my heroes and role models, Steve Jobs, noted, \u201cYou can't connect the dots looking forward; you can only connect them looking backwards.\u201d\nToday, I can look back and connect the dots of the last decade. By working in four different industries (digital health, venture capital, investment banking, and academia), being involved with over a dozen for-profit and nonprofit organizations, living in various parts of the world, overcoming personal challenges, celebrating successes, facing family issues, and cherishing some special moments in life, I learned some key lessons that I would like to share with the newly graduated students. I hope you can take these points and be a few steps ahead of where I started when I graduated: \n1) Be a human above and beyond any other role you accept: We all take many roles in our lives: father, mother, daughter, son, teacher, investor, writer, friend, wife, sister, brother, advisor, advocate, doctor, coder, administrator, mentor, board member, president, CEO, founder and the list goes on.\nWe do some of these roles better than the others. What\u2019s sad is that a lot of times people lose their humanity and compassion along the way, their sense of caring for others. I want to encourage you to always be human above and beyond any other role you may hold.      \n2) Listen to your heart and follow your passion: Listening to your heart and doing what you love will lead to true happiness which most of the time is SO hard to achieve.\n3) Discover your life mission: Living a mission-driven life allows you to wake up everyday and go to ANY battle because you know what you are doing is important. Having clear life mission empowers you to say NO to things that are not aligned with your goals and missions. That makes your decision making process so much easier and your life more fulfilling. Life is too short to do things that you don\u2019t value.\n4) Define the metrics of success for your life: Many of us tend to set goals and metrics of success for our companies, products, etc. However, a lot of times we are overwhelmed with our demanding day-to-day lives and forget to set goals and metrics for our own lives; we forget to ask questions like:\nWhat do I value the most?\nWhat kind of life do I want to have?\nDo I want family or not? What about career?\nDo I care to spend time with my parents, friends, etc?\nDo I want to be the best father or the best astronaut? What are the tradeoffs if any?\nTo get better in setting and tracking your life metrics, I would recommend that you read \u201cHow Will You Measure Your Life\u201d, the book from the reputable Harvard Business School Professor, Clay Christensen.\n5) Stand behind what\u2019s right: This could be challenging at times and subjective in many cases. But use your best judgment and always support what\u2019s right. It will eventually pay off.  \n6) Try to put yourself in other person\u2019s shoes before any action or reaction: Every time you want to criticize someone or have a harsh response to them, take a breath and put yourself in their shoes; I can guarantee that your reactions will be different 90% of the times. Adhere to the golden rule and treat others how you want to be treated.\n7) Try to be helpful and it will go a long way: If you develop the mentality of being helpful first and foremost - before thinking about what is in it for you, things may have surprisingly positive outcomes for you. With that attitude, others naturally will be gravitated to you; they want to be your friend; they want to be on your teams. These will lead to having a tight network of family, friends, colleagues, and teams that will make your life fulfilling, rewarding, and worth living.\n8) Be unstoppable, yet flexible. Life is tough, so you need to be tough too! Throughout your life and career you might face countless challenges and need to overcome them. Life has unexpected surprises - some are very good and other not so much. You should not let challenges and hardships stop you from pushing forward to the best of your abilities. On the other hand, you want to be flexible to changes or else you will constantly hit at the wall. Flexibility in your thinking and attitude allows you to find a door or window to pass through rather than hit a wall.\n9) Use challenges as opportunities\u2026 and don\u2019t give up: If you view any challenge you face as an opportunity to learn and get better, you will be much happier person and more in peace with yourself.\n10) Don\u2019t just say you want something, strategize how you can get there: Then put your mind and energy behind it.  \nCONGRATULATIONS to all the new graduates -- particularly to my students -- and their families. Graduating from college is a big life milestone and one that doesn't come without a lot of hard work, commitment, and family support. Congratulations for reaching to the finish line! I'm certain each of you will have a great life ahead and will get a chance to take many steps towards making the world a better place. Live your life to the fullest and be awesome! \n\n\n\n      "}, {"author": "Yasi Baiani", "headline": "Secret of Goal Setting & Achieving Them", "body": "Happy 2017! Another year and another opportunity to reset, re-center, and regain the control of your life. Science shows that setting goals increases the chance of achievements. It gives you sense of direction and purpose and motivates you to work towards your goals.\nI wrote another blog post about \u201cTips for Reaching Your Goals\u201d last year. Here, I wanted to add a few points to help you set more meaningful goals for 2017 and increase your chances of success in achieving them.  \nI set seven goals in 2016 and reached five out of seven already, and there\u2019s a good chance I can complete one more in early 2017 (so a bit later than 2016, but directionally I\u2019m on the right track). So I\u2019m almost at 85% goal completion rate for 2016. This is slightly higher than my goal completion rate of 80% in 2015. What\u2019s important though, is that my goals in 2016 were 5x more difficult to achieve than my 2015 goals. So how was I able to keep the goal completion rate so high? Here are a few secrets to share with you:\n1) Have a short list of things you really want to achieve: Don\u2019t let your 2017 goals become a long list of wishes and nice-to-have things. Life is too busy and it\u2019s hard to focus on your goals if those are not just a few very clear ones. If you are a newbie in goal setting process, don\u2019t go beyond five goals for the whole year. If you have done goal settings before and had good success, you may have a longer list. In general, I recommend the shorter and more concise list of goals.\n2) Pick a goal that you \u201creally\u201d care about: If you want do something so bad you will go above and beyond to make it happen. I have a friend of mine who lost 40 lbs in 6 months. She really, so badly wanted to lose her extra weight, and she did it! She was so committed to her goal that every time we went out for dinner or even when I cooked her favorite food she didn\u2019t even taste it. She said, \u201cI have a goal and in order to reach that I need to stay to the course.\u201d That\u2019s the type of commitment needed to reach BIG goals!  \n3) Make your goals as measurable as possible: Do you see a number in your goal statement? If not, it\u2019s not measurable enough. Make sure your goal statement has a number, date, and frequency; without those it\u2019s hard to assess if you hit your goal or not.\nHere are some examples of measurable goals:\na) I want to exercise 222 days out of 365 days of the year. That\u2019s about exercising 4 out of 7 days a week. You can measure this by logging your exercise everyday and know if you are on track or not in a weekly and monthly basis.\nAn alternative to this would have been \u201cI want to exercise more in 2017\u201d. As you can see, the second version is vague and not measurable.  \nb) I want to improve my relationship with my significant other by texting her 3 nice texts everyday and go to a date with her every month. Do you think this is measurable enough?\nc) I want to become a more effective financial analyst by decreasing time spent on excel sheet by 15% per day by the end of Q2 while completing the same type of reports as before. Do you think this is a good goal statement?\n4) Assign categories to your goals to have a balanced list: To have a well-rounded, fulfilled life, you need to focus on more than just one dimension. For instance, if you have all your 2017 goals as professional goals, you may end the year feeling your personal health and relationships are suffering. In order to have a balanced set of goals for the year, try to break them down into categories.\nAs an example, my 2017 goals are under three buckets: 1) personal; 2) family & friends; and 3) professional. The personal category are things that I want to do to make me feel better as an individual or help me grow. An example could be practicing Spanish everyday on your way to work with Duolingo with the goal of being 25% fluency rate by the end of the year (Duolingo gives fluency rate which enables \u201cmeasuring\u201d your goal / achievement).\nThe family and friends category are anything that I want to do for my immediate family, friends, colleague, and people I interact with. For me, I realized that my 2016 became so busy with work, speaking at conferences, delivering big projects, and my immediate family that I spent a lot less time with friends and colleagues that I would like to. My 2017 resolution is to not only allocate more time with my friends and colleagues, but also increase my compassion in general towards everyone in my circle. I want to make sure I carve out time to listen to a story of a stranger who needs someone to listen and care; I want to go visit that sick family friend who needs someone to open her door and say \u201cI\u2019m here to see YOU\u201d. As a result, one of my goals under this category is to do 12 things (once per month) that I or almost 90% of people won\u2019t carve out time to do in a regular busy days. I want to do 12 acts of kindness.\nI hope this post is a good inspiration for you to also set (and write down) your 2017 goals and take steps to make them happen through out the year, one at a time. Wishing you a wonderful year ahead. Now, go set your goals if you haven't already!"}, {"author": "Yasi Baiani", "headline": "Product Analysis: What Contributes to Uber's Extraordinary Success", "body": "[This blog post is based on my personal view and does not in any way reflect the opinions of the current organization I work for].\nBuilding a unicorn company is extremely challenging; creating a decacorn business (valued over $10bn) is pretty much beyond imagination. Uber, with over $65bn valuation, is one of the few decacorn tech companies of this decade. In the journey of becoming a multi-billion dollar company, Uber founders, executives, and teams have done so many things right. Their exceptionally fast growth, high economic impact, powerful user value, and superior product experience are great things to analyze and learn from.\nThere are plenty of great analyses on the reasons behind Uber\u2019s exceptional triumph, including the ruthless attitude of Uber\u2019s founder, the company's successful growth hacking and demand creation strategy, and its effective approach of building a 2-sided market led by industry experts such as Andrew Chen. Taking a different perspective, in this article I decided to primarily focus on Uber as a product. Below are six reasons that Uber\u2019s product contributed to the company\u2019s success:  \n1) No hailing; no waiting: The best thing about Uber is that it solves a real problem. Pre-Uber time, taking a cab could be an exasperating experience. When you called for a cab, you could end up waiting anywhere between 10-45 minutes. A lot of times the cab driver who accepted your request would change his mind and never show up; you had no way to know, as there was no direct interaction between a passenger and a driver -- all the communications happened through a taxi dispatch, and there was no map to track the driver like there is today on the Uber app.   \nAnother option for getting a cab was to hail one on the street. However, despite having the availability light on, there was never any guarantee that the cab was actually available. Sometimes drivers forgot to change the status of their availability light. Other times they just weren\u2019t in the mood to take you.\nUber came in and with its product offering solved all the main customer pain points for taking a ride. It enables users to request a cab via an application on their phones. It connects drivers and passengers directly rather than having a call center in between. Uber consistently offers reliable pick up time, calculated by Uber algorithms based on the number of drivers available in each area, their distance to a passenger, user rating, traffic, and other factors. The combination of these features took away the pain of taking a cab and made it a pleasant experience.\nLesson Learned: Solve a real problem; solve a big problem...and the rest will follow.     \n2) Zero second payment process: Prior to Uber, the point of sales (payment time) was one of the most cumbersome parts of a taxi ride. In a lot of cases, the taxi\u2019s archaic credit card machine would fail at the time the driver wanted to charge the passenger. Then the driver had to reboot the machine and hope it worked. This would resulted a long wait time which was neither pleasant for the driver nor the passenger.\nBecause of these challenges and the cut the credit card companies would take out of each charge, drivers desired cash payments; however, many passengers didn\u2019t carry enough cash. This always created tension between drivers and passengers.   \nUber came in and, with its auto-payment system, made the process of paying for a ride seamless. It guarantees drivers will get paid since each passenger must have a valid credit card on file in order for their Uber app to be functional; it also brought the time to pay for a ride to zero seconds. (Who can beat that?!) Passengers get out of the car and Uber automatically charges the user\u2019s credit card on file.\nLesson Learned: Solve a real problem from multiple angles. Can you fix more than one thing for your customers?\n3) Only three clicks to request a cab: After creating a profile on Uber (a one time event), a passenger can always order a cab with only three clicks: 1) enter a pick up address 2) tap on \u201cset pickup location\u201d 3) request an UberX -- or any other tier of service the user prefers.\nThe ease of use and minimum steps required to order a cab is the art of Uber\u2019s product design. The simplicity and intuitiveness of Uber\u2019s product led to growth of the company because anyone, even non-tech-savvy users, can easily use the Uber application.   \nLesson Learned: If you want to build a product that eventually targets everyone in the world, design for simplicity and ease of use.\n4) Minimum information presented in each screen: \u201cLess is more\u201d is another admirable product approach Uber takes. If you\u2019ve noticed, you only see the minimum information needed at each stage of using the Uber app; all the \u201cnice-to-have\u201d pieces are cut from the app\u2019s core experience.  \nWhile ordering a cab, the user only sees: two fields to enter the pickup and drop-off addresses, number of cabs nearby, the estimated time one could get to her, and the tier of Uber services to select from (UberX, Pool, etc). Also, Uber takes away additional work from the user by guessing her pick up address and always keeping the default tier of service to what the user chooses most often.\nWhen waiting for a cab, the user only sees the location of the cab at any given moment, the car model, and the driver\u2019s name, so that the passenger can easily locate her ride when it arrives. One thing that could be improved in this part of the app is the interaction for contacting a driver; the contact button is hidden and only accessible by tapping on the driver\u2019s name.\nWhen the ride is finished, the user only sees the charge amount and the option to rate and review the driver.\nLesson Learned: When you design a product, always assume less is more and be disciplined to show the minimum yet most useful information to users.\n5) Tracking on the map: This feature is probably one of the most valuable parts of the Uber experience. Creating this level of transparency about where your ride is at any given time is something that took away some of the main pain points of requesting a ride (see the first bullet point) and distinguished Uber from traditional cabs. The ability to track your ride on the map is a central part of the Uber experience; thus, Uber rightfully allocated more than two thirds of the screen to the map in the Uber app.\nLesson Learned: Identify the core feature(s) of your product and make sure they are a central part of the user experience in your product design.\n6) Make your back-end and algorithms smart: One of the most powerful parts of the Uber experience is its reliability and accuracy. Imagine requesting an Uber ride that shows you a pick-up time of 2 minutes but in reality it takes 20 minutes for your ride to arrive. How frustrating and unreliable that would be?! Behind Uber\u2019s simple UI are the well-designed algorithms that you never see but that power the user experience.\nLesson Learned: Don\u2019t shy away from investing in your algorithms and AI. They may not be user-facing, but they have significant impact on the user experience and credibility of your product."}, {"author": "Yasi Baiani", "headline": "5 Steps to Build a Customer-Driven Product & Company", "body": "There are multiple ways to approach the process of building a product. Different product owners (either product managers or entrepreneurs) have different strategies. Some will just go with their intuition about customers and market needs while others simply assume that their own problem must be that of others and go about building a product to address that problem. Although these might be good starting points, the process of assessing the validity of an idea shouldn\u2019t stop there. In fact, user and data driven product design and development is the only way to build top notch products that will take off!\nHenry Ford once said, \u201cIf I had asked people what they wanted, they would have said faster horses.\u201d Ford\u2019s adage may seem to contradict my point that user and data driven product design is best - that, in reality, users may not actually know what they want.\nHowever, based on my experience building innovative and cutting edge products that are used and loved by millions of people, I can guarantee that if a product owner listens hard enough and long enough to potential users she can learn what users want and, more importantly, what they don\u2019t want. Users may not hand the product owner a vision or the solution, but they will surely point her in the right direction.\nIn fact, the customer\u2019s voice is king in product development! To help you understand this more fully, I have outlined 5 essential steps to build a customer driven product development process and organization:     \n1. Customer\u2019s voice should be echoed from all parts of the organization: Let the customer\u2019s voice be channeled to your product team from all parts of your organization especially sales, marketing, and customer service teams. These groups are in the front line, working with customers and gaining lots of insights into what customers need or like. Thus, these teams\u2019 feedback should be key in defining and designing your product.  \n2. Make various research methods part of your development DNA: There are various tools and techniques that enable a customer driven product development mentality. Some of these tools include surveys, user interviews, usability testing, prototype testing, and beta testing. All these techniques lead to the collection of qualitative or quantitative information that should shape product decisions and designs.\nEach of these methods are most effective at different phases of product development. For instance, user interviews are best used in early phase of product development to help the product owner understand user\u2019s sentiment around a particular topic. On the other hand, usability testing comes later in the product development process when designs are already available. Usability testing helps identify whether the designs offered are intuitive or not.  \nIn order to build an experience that people will really love and embrace, you should use more than one of these research methods before building any product.\n3. Test strategy before launch strategy: Generally product owners think about when and how they want to launch a feature or product. But many times they forget to clearly lay out their pre-launch testing strategy. Testing any feature or product before launch is key for gaining confidence in its quality and performance; thus, the product owner should clearly lay out the testing plan and incorporate the time necessary for testing into her product development timeline.\nVarious types of testings should happen in different phases of product development. Each test will provide different types of insight and information for the product owner. For instance, early prototype testing with real users enables the product owner to see if her original idea and the way it is designed seems appealing to the target customers or not. On the other hand, beta stage product testing should come right before the product launch, and it is meant to catch the final bugs and perfect the last versions of the product. One should expect that the final product will be quite different than the early prototypes ( as you collect more data you will improve your product), but there should be minimal changes to the product between beta and launch.\nTesting the product early and often allows you to land on the perfect product market fit. So piloting your product with your early adopters or your cheerleading customers is one of the most important steps in product development.\n4. Let data speak stronger than opinions: Many product owners fall into the trap of letting their gut feeling or ego drive the product development process. Although it\u2019s great to have confidence in your vision and plan, it\u2019s critical to set assumptions and test your idea against those assumptions. Collect data and be honest with yourself about what that data is representing. It\u2019s sometimes easy to get emotional about your idea and ignore data, even when data is available. Letting data prove your vision is the best route to build successful products quickly and with minimum development cost. \n5. Kill the solution not the problem: A lot of times the product owner\u2019s observation for a problem in the world is the right one. However, finding the right solution for that problem may not always be a simple answer.

The discussion could help benefit everyone."}, {"author": "Yasi Baiani", "headline": "How to Get More Women to the Top", "body": "The lack of women in the executive levels of companies is not a secret anymore. This topic has been widely discussed as a major problem for individuals, companies, and societies.\nDespite various researchers such as the one conducted with Peterson Institute for International Economics that showed an increase in the number of women from 0 to 30 percent would be associated with a 15 percent rise in profitability, there is still a very slow progress on changing the demographic of the c-suite and boardrooms.\nThe same research from the Peterson Institute on 22,000 companies in 91 countries showed that 60 percent of companies had no female board members and over 50 percent of them had no female executive. Just under 5 percent had a female CEO. In the same study, American companies had only 12 percent of board seats going to women and 16 percent of executive positions.\nAs you can see, these numbers for the 21st century, are nothing but shocking, embarrassing, and disappointing!\nGiven that there has been so much written on \u201cthe problem\u201d itself, I want to shy away from writing about \u201cthe problem\u201d again! But rather, I would prefer to focus on \u201cthe solutions.\u201d Because I strongly believe that everyone in all parts of organizations and societies can take steps to change these numbers and improve outcomes.\nI decided to break down this post to two parts: Part One, which is the one you are reading now, will offer practical solutions to men and women who are in the managerial and executive levels. Part Two, which will be published later, will offer tactical solutions to women and men who are earlier in their careers.\nWhat can you do as a male high level executive or mid-level manager to change the ratios?\n- Keep your biases in check: we all know that inevitably each of us has biases that were shaped based on our experiences and exposures in life. Although it\u2019s hard to fully eliminate our biases, being aware of them and consciously control them could significantly change the decisions we make as individuals. For instance, men tend to pay more attention and give more credit to points brought up in meetings or conferences by other men than those brought up by women. Also, both men and women have more tendency to go grab lunch or coffee with the same gender at work. These are subtle and small biases that overtime could have big impacts.\nNext time you are in a meeting try to have more eye contact with other female colleagues and give their ideas as equal credit as you would to those of your male colleagues. If you are a speaker on a panel, make sure to do the same thing. As a male executive invite your female direct reports to grab lunch or drinks with you, if you do that with their male counterparts.\n- Think twice before rejecting a female candidate: It\u2019s also proven that people tend to hire people similar to themselves. For male high level executives and mid-level managers it\u2019s critical to be conscious of this and ensure that you are not rejecting a talented and qualified female candidate just because she may not be similar to you.\nLosing talents due to these biases is extremely sad and could have negative business consequences -- because we know diversity improves financial outcomes.  An easy solution is before rejecting a female candidate, do an honest check with yourself and ensure no personal biases is impacting your decision.\n- Put an extra effort in identifying female talents in your company and promoting them: At the Wisdom 2.0 conference this year, Natalia Oberti Noguera, the Founder and CEO, Pipeline Fellowship, mentioned that research showed men get promoted based on \"potential\" and women get promoted based on \"performance\". This is a sad piece of information and one that I hope high level male executives take a direct action and put conscious effort to change.\nGiven that the battle for finding top talent will only get more intense in many industries such as tech and healthcare, it\u2019s critical for executives and mid-level managers to identify talented female employees and put an extra effort to keep and promote them. This allows the company to benefit from an untapped market of high potential female talents and leaders as well as unleash their extraordinary potential to drive top and bottom lines.\nWhat can you do as a female high level executive or mid-level manager to change the ratios?\n- Be a great role model: Given that you are part of a very small pool of female executives or mid-level managers, many high potential women, earlier in their careers, are closely watching you and might be trying to follow your foot-prints. Continue lean in and be that role model, so that more women can materialize and visualize that getting to the top is a possibility for them.  \n- Don\u2019t be afraid to stand for other women: A lot of times I heard from high level female managers and executives that they were worried to stand for hiring or promoting another woman. They were concerned that this comes across as a favor of a woman to another woman.\nLet\u2019s be more courageous than that. Let\u2019s stand for merit and talent versus gender differences. Let\u2019s build a strong pipeline of women as there is so much room for improvement and growth at every level of every organization for women. \n- Be a champion of change and improvements in your company: As a high level female executive or mid-level manager, no one could be a better champion for this topic than you. If you are in those positions try to bring up and implement changes about females\u2019 promotions, females\u2019 mentorships, maternity/paternity leave policies, and day care system among many other topics that require attention in order to keep and cultivate female talents in your company. \n- Mentor high potential female candidates: We all know that a good mentor could change an individual's life and career path. I\u2019ve personally been fortunate to have many male and female mentors who significantly impact my career.\nOne important reality is that as of today, the number of women in the top executive levels are very small. Therefore, many high potential women are struggling to find the right female role model, much less one who has time and willingness to train them and mentor them.\nIf you are a woman at the top executive level or high level managerial roles, see if you could open some time in your busy schedule to mentor women in your company or other women who may reach out to you. I\u2019m certain any hour a young talented woman spends with people like you, their chances of success and reaching to the top could substantially increase.\nChange starts slow, and could start from each of us!\nChange starts small, but its outcome could be big!\nDon\u2019t you want to be part of and pioneer of something big?!\nThen join the movement, lean in, have an impact, and share this with others in your network to invite them to participate as well."}, {"author": "Yasi Baiani", "headline": "Tips for Reaching Your Goals in 2016", "body": "Happy 2016! Do you have new resolutions for 2106? How do you go about setting those milestones? Based on your previous year resolutions and their outcomes, do you feel satisfied by the methods you applied in the past? \nThe start of the New Year is a good time to think about what you want to accomplish in the coming months. Perhaps you have already committed to a New Year's resolution, which is a good start.\nHowever, resolutions tend to be all or nothing. Resolution is a decision or determination to do something. A lot of times, as part of our resolution, we actually tend to focus on what we don't want to do -- quitting carbohydrates this year -- rather than what we do want to achieve. Most importantly, most of the new year resolutions tend to be short-term and don't have a solid strategy on how to sustain them for a whole year and beyond. Perhaps that's why only 8% of people who make a New Year's resolution actually keep it.\nInstead, goals are the result toward which effort is directed. They tend to be longer term, and there is a need for a good strategy or execution plan in order to achieve them. \nI personally don't set new year resolutions. Instead, in the last few years, I always set big goals at the beginning of the year. The following tactics really helped me to deliver over 80% of my personal and professional goals that I set for myself at the beginning of the year. Try them out and see how they work for you in 2016:\nSecret of Prioritization: First, list everything that you are hoping to achieve in that year; then make the list shorter so it's not more than 5 or 6 items. A short list will help you to always remember your goals for the year.\nClear & Measurable: Make your goals crystal clear with specifics, timelines, and measurable outcomes. That's the only way you can track if you hit your goal or not.\nSpell Them Out: In order to keep track of your multiple goals over a year and don't forget about the specifics you set, it's highly recommended to jot them down somewhere that only you can have access to. For some people, they actually prefer to put their goals in front of them (post them on their bedroom or bathroom wall), so they see it every day. For others, they prefer to keep it private. \nSet Smaller Milestones: If it will help you to have smaller goals to see how you are progressing towards that bigger goal, you can set some monthly or quarterly milestones for yourself. My suggestion is that don't add those as part of your list of top goals or else your main list will get long and busy, so it will be harder to keep track of the big goals.  \nBreak Them Down into Multi-year Goals: Some goals are big enough that you need to break them down into multi-year goals. For instance, if you are a freshman in college, your goal by the end of the year can't realistically be graduation. However, you can set clear, actionable, and measurable goals for this year that could help you with a successful graduation with top grades and resume in a few years. \nHave an Execution Plan: It's not just important to set a goal, but more importantly you have to have clear idea on how you aim to work towards achieving that goal.\nBe Flexible: Life will still bring us its ups and downs and surprises along the way. So it's impossible to predict all it has to offer us at the beginning of the year and plan everything accordingly. Be open to new information you will receive during the year and adjust some of your goals if necessary.\nThese goal setting technics really helped me in the last few years. Give them a try in 2016 and keep me posted on the outcomes. If others have different tips and tricks that worked well for them in the past, please share them below with other readers.\nHave a fabulous and productive year everyone! "}, {"author": "Yasi Baiani", "headline": "How to Build the Next Unicorn in Healthcare", "body": "[This blog post is based on my personal view and does not in any way reflect the opinions of the current organization I work for].\nRecently, RockHealth published an article, talking about \u201cWhy there is no Uber in Healthcare?\u201d Also, Aileen Lee\u2019s more recent Unicorn Analysis from the Summer of 2015, showed that out of 84 existing unicorns*, only a handful are in the health sector including Zenefits, Oscar Health, and Zocdoc.\nTypically, building a unicorn company is super challenging with odds being against the founders every single day. This difficulty magnifies ten times more, when we are speaking about building a unicorn in the land of healthcare, given its regulations and archaic systems that are established and hard to change.  \nDespite all the challenges, some entrepreneurs have actually succeeded to build unicorns in healthcare. Given my entrepreneurial spirit and can-do attitude, I would like to believe that in the next five years we will see a lot more digital health unicorns born and scale.  \nHere, I would like to give you some tactical tips to help you build a unicorn digital health startup that delivers high value and that changes healthcare for better:    \n1) Understand the current healthcare system: The best entrepreneurs and founders have great understanding of their sectors; healthcare is no exception. If you don\u2019t understand the current system well, how you want to lead your company to offer something better than others, something that it\u2019s guaranteed to be adapted and used by different players in the healthcare system, will it be the physicians, insurance companies, or consumers/patients!?   \nWhile a clear understanding of the current healthcare system is essential, you also need to be aware that changing the status quo will always face resistance. You need to be ready to address those resistance you will face in healthcare quickly in order to scale your business. To give you an example, physicians have an established process when they see a patient. Many of them would show resistance to introduce a new step in their workflow such as reading wearables\u2019 information to better understand their patient\u2019s 24/7 health performance.\nAs a healthcare entrepreneur, it\u2019s your job to understand these types of hurdles, resistances, and biases in the healthcare system in advance of your product launch and find ways to navigate through them.\n2) Know your customers: Getting into your customers' head and understanding their psychology behind any purchasing decision is key for success of any company. Despite success of on-demand businesses such as Uber, Airbnb, and Instacart and their explosive growth, on-demand healthcare companies still are in a much slower growth trajectory. You may ask why...\nOne reason is that when it comes to health, consumers aren\u2019t as open to try new and unknown services. Additionally, many users may perceive the quality of health services that can be provided at an established, full-on health center to be much higher than what can be delivered via video-chat or from a doctor-on-the-go, who will visit you at your home. How do you design your product, brand, and company, so that you can overcome such perceptions and challenges?\n3) Have product hooks: In order for your product or service to be successful and deliver atypical growth needed to build a unicorn, you need to build \u201chooks\u201d that bring your users back over and over to your platform. (If you haven\u2019t read Hook from Nir Eyal, I highly recommend it).\nIn my view, Facebook has done this better than any other company. Each new feature is a strong hook that contributes to the product stickiness and increases user engagement. That\u2019s why over one billion people go to Facebook in a daily basis. It\u2019s addictive and filled with hooks. What are your product hooks for your digital health company?  \n4) Have a clear monetization strategy and understand your customers\u2019 willingness-to-pay: At the end of the day, cash is king! Businesses that succeed in the long term pump revenues (and ideally profits) like no others. As a founder of a healthcare company, it\u2019s super important that you have a clear monetization path from early on and rigorously test your monetization assumptions. Given that historically payers and consumers/patients have been different entities in healthcare, building a direct-to-consumer business with expectation that consumers instead of insurances will pay for your service now has its own challenges.\nAdditionally, if you offer a B2B product or service, consider how you help businesses \u201csave money\u201d. That\u2019s the best way to easily convince enterprises to pay for your product or service. If all you have to offer is a \u201cbetter\u201d product or service, but not per se a more cost effective one, your sale cycles will be much longer, and it will take you more time to become a unicorn if at all.\n5) Know the rules and regulations: Healthcare is filled with rules and regulations. Some reasonable, some totally archaic and non-sense. At the end of the day though, as an entrepreneur in this sector, you need to know those rules really well and find ways to navigate through them. You may decide to push the boundaries on some of the rules, but make sure that you do them smartly. Zenefit is a good example of a healthcare unicorn that\u2019s now struggling and getting hit for not following the rules; Theranos is another multi-billion dollar healthcare company under the scrutiny due to the lack of transparency and for providing misleading information.  \n6) What\u2019s your unfair competitive advantage? As an entrepreneur in any sector you need to have a competitive advantage that allows you to build your company faster than other founders. How can you do that? If you answer \u201cyes\u201d to more than one of the questions below, you probably have a competitive edge:\nDo you have an unique knowledge into the healthcare sector that allows you to build a right product with the best hooks faster than others?\nDo you have unfair access to a pull of talent and can hire best people faster than others?\nDo you know the right investors with big pockets who are willing to invest in you and your idea?\nAre you a hustler and ruthless executor like no-one else?  \nAre you a visionary and a solution finder?\n\nGiven that it\u2019s really hard for any entrepreneur to be outstanding in all the dimensions mentioned above from product to regulations, I highly recommend that you surround yourself with top notch advisors (more than one) who have great understanding of the healthcare system. They could help you stay out of trouble and succeed building a long-lasting unicorn.\nIf you are a healthcare entrepreneur, please share your views and experiences in the comments below. If you are an aspiring entrepreneur, I hope this spark some ideas and give you useful tips to apply to your next venture.\n* Unicorns are referred to companies whose valuation has exceeded $1 billion dollars."}, {"author": "Yasi Baiani", "headline": "Land a Job That Fits You Like Second Skin", "body": "In the busy and fast-paced of western world, most of us probably spend more time working than doing any other activities (e.g. sleeping, exercising, relaxing, spending quality time with our families and friends). So we might as well do what we love rather than just do \u201csomething\u201d or hold \u201ca\u201d job.  \nThe spark for this blog post came from an overwhelming number of questions, calls, and emails I received within the last year from friends, friends of friends, and strangers who wanted to learn more about how I landed a role that I\u2019m super passionate about and how I decided to join Fitbit versus other companies -- the second question came from people who knew me closely and were aware of different opportunities I was assessing. Thus, I decided to share my experience with a broader group here to inspire and empower others to seek what they are most passionate about and to help them reach their dreams, whatever that might be. Below are five fundamental concepts that I believe will help you find a job that fits you like second skin:\n1) Discover and follow your passion: The beauty of working on what you are super excited about is that work feels like play. Additionally, if you are passionate about what you work on, you will spend more time thinking about the problems in that field and coming up with better solutions than other people who don\u2019t have the same passion. This will give you significant edge and competitive advantage over time.\n2) Know your strengths and chose a role accordingly: Being aware of what your strengths and best skills are is an invaluable insight. That awareness will allow you to not only pick a role that you are most excited about, but also one at which you can deliver significant business values.\n3) Pursue the passion that\u2019s in a high growth industry: Despite the fact that Ben Horowitz is one of my heroes and role models, my knee jerk reaction to his Columbia University commencement speech on \u201cDon\u2019t Follow Your Passion\u201d was that what the hell is he talking about! That\u2019s the worst advice you can give to new graduates! However, after listening to his talk and pondering his points, I can\u2019t agree with him more.\nIf you find your passion in an industry that\u2019s shrinking or dying, it will be a lot more challenging to have a high impact and successful career.  The good news is that most of us have more than one passion. What you need to do to discover your passions is to go through a deep self-discovery experience. As part of that process, there are some of the questions you need to answer (and try to be really honest with yourself):\nWhat makes you tick in life?\nWhat are your hobbies?  \nWhat were the things you liked to do as a kid?\nWhat technologies, products, or experiences excite you?\n\n4) Shape and express your point of view about your industry: One of my favorite professors at Harvard, Professor Gunnar Trumbull, gave us valuable career advice that has stuck with me. He told us that we would each reach the height of our career if and when we become experts in our field. He said that when people call you up to ask your advice on a particular topic, that\u2019s when you know you\u2019re on the right path. In other words, you need to be a brand, something that you stand for!\nThere are many ways to build your expertise. Here are a few tactical tips to help you develop your knowledge and build your brand:\nRead, research, and experiment a ton in the area that you are passionate about.\nShape your point of view on what will work and what not in your area of focus.\nShare your knowledge and view with others by commenting on forums such as Quora, where people seek other's expertise, writing blog posts on topics that you are passionate about, and speaking at relevant events.\n5) Have your criteria straight to be able to say \u201cno\u201d to the wrong opportunities: If you don\u2019t know what type of role or industry you would like to land on, it will be very hard to make it a reality. It\u2019s like people who want to be in a serious relationship, but have no idea what their type is! It\u2019s absolutely fine to spend some time and explore, but at some point you need to set your criteria.  \nYour criteria could totally change over time, but you need to clearly know what you want at any given time in order to make reasonable (vs. emotional) decisions. You don\u2019t want to say \u201cyes\u201d to every job offer you\u2019ll receive, just like you wouldn\u2019t want to say \u201cyes\u201d to any guy or girl who wants to go out with you.\nSome of the criteria that are important to sort out for your next career move are the followings:\nIn what role or department could you add the most value: engineering, product, design, marketing, business development, corporate development, etc.?\nIn what industry would you like to work?\nWhat size company will fit you best: seed-round, Series A, B, C, growth company, or a public company?  \nWhat type of culture would best fit your personality and work style?\nWhat are your deal breakers?\nWhat job attributes will most contribute to your overall happiness: location, opportunity for growth, compensation, job security, title, opportunity for learning, mentorship, etc.? \nIn order to make the right career choice that brings you satisfaction and happiness and that meets most of your personal and professional criteria, I highly recommend that you figure out your list of criteria first, and then stick to it.      \nI truly hope each and everyone of you who are reading this post and pondering if you are at the right role or company, or if you could instead maximize your talent and passion elsewhere, start a self-discovery journey and find what\u2019s the best fit for you soon.

A good example of such robots is Roomba, iRobot vacuum cleaner, which automatically cleans homes of millions of common people who own one of these robots.   \nIn the next decade, we\u2019ll see the robots\u2019 impacts will exponentially increase in our lives and they will seamlessly become part of our everyday lives. Although that seems kind of scary, my bet is that, like all other new technologies, the net benefits of robots will overweight the downside. Below are a few ways that I can envision robots will find their ways into our homes:\n1) Substitute the on-demand workers in the sharing economy: As you may know, Uber has heavily invested in the self-driving cars and poached 40 of the top robotic talents & scientists from one of the most credible robotics research institutes, Carnegie Mellon University. From the Uber\u2019s recent moves, it\u2019s clear that the company is committed to swap its drivers with robots in the near future.\nIt\u2019s not hard to imagine that robots will find their way into many sharing economy companies that their service providers have very routine tasks. Think of Instacart shoppers, Alfred, and Washio Ninjas as a potential candidates. As long as we can get the walking and fully functional robots that could be programed for chores, they could be provided with the addresses, orders, and tasks and sent out to do their jobs. It\u2019s important to note that getting to a point that we have fully functional and independent robots it\u2019s not a trivial process. However, the exciting news is that with all the researches, developments, and investments in the robotics we are getting closer to this.    \n2) Robots will be integrated into the IoT at homes: Think Roomba meets Nest becomes a reality! Scientists from MIT Media Labs, to industry pioneers (iRobots Founders) and behemoth tech companies such as Apple and Google are working hard and spending millions of dollars to make this wild dream a reality.\nWith the expansion of IoT and connected home devices as well as advancement of robots, it\u2019s promising to have a Robot Maid in the next decade. Imagine you can program your robot to cook and serve your favorite meals every night when you get home. Through IoT technology, you may be able to control your Robot Maid from the office and program him to turn on your washing machine before you are home. Who doesn't want one of those robots?! So you can imagine that consumer demand for such robots will be really high. At this point technological limitations are the main holdback, and eventually pricing could be an initial hurdle. However, overtime you can imagine that many people could have a Robot Maid.  \n3) Robots with emotions could become our companion and maybe even our partner one day: Imagine a world that those of us who don\u2019t find our perfect match (partner) in the world can order a custom-made one online that will be delivered to our homes within a few weeks! How powerful, cool, and convenient is that!?  \nOk, we may not be there yet, but we are surely moving towards that direction. Jibo or Neo are the first steps towards social robots with emotions and human-like personalities. Overtime, we will see more robots who can imitate human behaviors, show us emotions, and thoughtfully react to our needs. They can carry conversations with us just like a friend or partner and can show us love and emotions.\nAlthough all the scenarios mentioned above required a lot of work and technological advancement to become a reality, I\u2019m optimistic and can see these happening in the coming decade.\nPlease spread the word by sharing this article and share your point of view in the comments."}, {"author": "Yasi Baiani", "headline": "10 Management Lessons Learned - From Harvard to Startup & Large Firms", "body": "During the last decade, I\u2019ve had the opportunity to take on various roles in companies of all sizes. My experiences have included being the founder of a startup, Product Lead in a high growth tech company, and Product Gal in a multi-billion dollar publicly traded healthcare IT firm. I also acquired management and leadership training at the best institution known for these topics -- Harvard Business School -- and spent two years analyzing hundreds of cases on the best and worst management and leadership styles.\nThrough all these experiences, I have learned a lot about management and leadership. Here are my top 10 take aways about what every manager/leader should do in order to succeed:    \n1. Master communication: This is the \u201cgolden rule\u201d of leadership and management. Clear and timely communication with your team is the most powerful tool you can have in your leadership toolkit.\n\n2. Share the vision, the pleasure, and the pain: The best way to get your team\u2019s support and buy-in is to share your vision with them and describe the foundation for certain decisions. Understanding the logic behind any decision allows your team to cope with a tough situation much better and support you and your decision. I repeatedly heard from my teams that they appreciated \u201ctransparency,\u201d even if the message delivered contained uncertainty or challenges.\n3. Don\u2019t just tell your team what to do, but also tell them why: Most people tend to be more inclined to do a great job on something when they understand the reasons behind the request. Your team will most likely end up doing a much better job on any project and request if you articulate how their contribution will impact the big picture and the company's success.\n4. Be an outstanding listener: Some may think leadership is about commanding others what to do. But, in fact, the most successful leaders are the ones who listen more than they talk. By giving the floor to others to talk, great leaders stimulate the creativity of their teams and enable them to generate their best ideas. Also, having others drive the discussions will provide a manager/leader with more information, which generally results in better outcomes. As was noted in the timeless best selling book, How to Win Friends & Influence People, \u201cNo one likes to take orders; asking questions is the way to lead.\u201d    \n5. Make decisions and stand by them: If you are in a leadership and management position, your teams and employees look up to you for answers and decisions. You may not have all the answers and all the information at all times, but don\u2019t forget that a big part of your job is to make the best judgement calls in lieu of unknowns. Try to gather as much information as you can to make informed decisions, but don\u2019t be one of those leaders that can never make up his mind. No one likes to work with those people.\n6. Remember to appreciate those who have done a good job: Everyone likes being appreciated; everyone likes being recognized. Be aware of this basic human need and make sure to appreciate your team members, your employees, and your colleagues. Every small thank you or recognition counts. And guess what? Employees tend to do a better job for the managers who recognize their work and appreciate them versus for those who don\u2019t.\n7. Support the best ideas, no matter who brought them up: In merit-based cultures, best ideas can get traction regardless of who brought them up. In companies with high politics, a lot of times the best ideas get shut down if they didn\u2019t come from the right person - top level executives. Such companies lose the opportunity to consider some of the best ideas because they shut them down too quickly. They also regularly frustrate some of their most talented people, which eventually leads to high attrition or low performance.      \n8. Be honest about what type of people you want and can hire: Theoretically, everyone wants to hire Type A players and top talents. However, it\u2019s a lot harder to engage and satisfy Type A employees than Type B or C. Is your company ready to hire Type A talent? Do you have the right infrastructure and team setup to empower Type A players? If not, you would be better off hiring Type B players because you won\u2019t be able to maximize on what the Type A players have to offer anyway.\n9. Don\u2019t trick your team: There is nothing more bothersome to employees than a dishonest manager. I have heard frustrated employees telling stories of managers who said things like, \u201cThis meeting is a safe place and an open platform for you to share your complains or things we can improve in our team or company.\u201d And then that same manager used the employees\u2019 feedback against them and brought them down. This is not cool and not acceptable!  \n10. Discover each person\u2019s talent and style: Not every employee is the same. Each person has his/her own personality, work style, strengths, and weaknesses. Best managers quickly recognize these differences in each person and work with that employee according to his/her style. Basically, managing other individuals isn\u2019t a one-size-fits-all. You need different tactics for different people on your team. Mastery comes when you apply those tactics smoothly and interchangeably without you or others even noticing. \nWhat do you think about any of these points? Have you experienced the same things as a manager or as a team member? Please share your experiences and insights about management and leadership for all of us to learn from each other. "}, {"author": "Yasi Baiani", "headline": "What to Expect in 2015 in the Wearable & IoT World?", "body": "[This blog is my personal view of the wearable market and doesn\u2019t reflect the view of the organization I work for.]\nFor much of 2014, wearable technology has been the subject of great hype and even greater skepticism, fueled by speculation around whether these emerging devices will have a positive or negative impact on our lives. Some people think that wearables are a fad. Others claim they have no impact. However, many of us believe that wearables are here to stay! We suspect that the ability to collect data about ourselves and our surroundings are phenomena that will change our lives forever for the better, and that they will not go away anytime soon. We are now at the tipping point of the wearable revolution. Here are some of my predictions for what we will witness in the rest 2015:\n1. Wearables will go mainstream: One in five American adults already owns a wearable device, according to a PwC report. That\u2019s on par with tablets in 2012, when the adoption rate sat at 20% after just two years on the market. Today more than 40% of Americans own a tablet, and it seems reasonable to expect similar adoption patterns with wearables.\nEnterprises will play a major role in subsidizing and mainstreaming wearables in 2015. Many enterprises already embrace health and fitness trackers as part of their corporate wellness programs. We will see more companies subsidize smart watches and fitness trackers, especially as these products become more cross-functional. Imagine the benefits that wearables could bring to organizations if their employees could receive texts or emails on their wrists or be able to access company\u2019s applications and documents through these devices 24/7. This could directly impact employee\u2019s responsiveness and productivity.\nIn addition, if wearables could even slightly improve the health and wellbeing of employees, cost savings for employers could be significant. Interestingly enough, employers and employees\u2019 incentives seem to align in this regard. While employers could benefit from reduced healthcare costs, employees could also enjoy lower health insurance fees in addition to increased health and wellbeing. In fact, 70% of consumers reported that they would wear employer-provided wearables in exchange for a break on their insurance premium.\n2. Transition from tracking to changing behavior: Critics of wearables complain that these products merely track and present data about the past without any predictive analysis or mechanisms to help users change their behavior for better. This criticism has merit, but it is important to note that passive data tracking is only the first phase of the wearable movement, and a necessary building block for what can be done next. Changing a user\u2019s behavior and providing her with predictive insight would not have been possible without going through the first stage of passive data tracking. In near future, with machine learning and big data analytics, wearables and digital health companies could significantly help users to take appropriate actions and make healthier decisions real time.\n3. Coupling of wearables & Internet of Things (IoT): The line between wearables and the IoT will get blurry in 2015. As users acquire more connected devices and start collecting more data about themselves, their homes, and their surroundings, their needs will change rapidly. Imagine the potential experience of a user with five or more devices \u2013 all of which collect data about her and her environment. It\u2019s easy to see that the marriage of wearables and the IoT could create new problems such as reconciliation of data as well as connection and communication across devices, but the flip side of that is the potential for numerous new market opportunities.\n4. Explosion of healthcare wearables: While consumers have not yet embraced healthcare wearable technologies in large scale, they are intrigued. On the supply side, super talented physicians, scientists, and engineers from top universities and labs are working on commercializing health projects and offering affordable digital health products to those with medical needs. In 2015 we will see more of these wearable healthcare products become available to patients with diabetes, Parkinson\u2019s disease, and heart failure.\n2015 may also see new regulations and laws related to these breakthroughs in science and technology. The inevitable disruptions happening in the healthcare system will force lawmakers to bring down related FDA requirements. This will help increase the adoption of healthcare wearables, and it may also encourage insurance companies to pay for the costs of those healthcare wearables that have proven outcomes.\n5. More crashes and burns as well as mergers and acquisitions: Based on venture capital research by CB Insight, $1.4 billion in venture funding has been invested in wearable companies since 2009, with over one-third of the money invested in 2014 alone. There were also millions of dollars raised by wearable startups on crowdfunding sites such as Kickstarter and Indiegogo.\nIn general, the odds of success for a startup are really low. Building a successful and scalable wearable business is even more challenging because of the complications introduced by mixing hardware and software technologies together. Thus, many wearable and IoT startups could fail miserably in 2015 and cost their investors a lot of money. Those companies that do succeed will witness a lot of mergers and acquisitions in this sector. The acquisition of Basis by Intel in 2014 was one of the first transactions in the wearable space. Startups that solve one vertical problem really well could be attractive acquisition targets. The reason is that over time, various functionalities would fold into only one device that user wants to wear 24/7. More mature tech companies such as Apple, Google, and Salesforce, who are hungry for a piece of the wearable market, could snag a lot of small, successful wearable and IoT players.\nOnly time will tell what will really happen for the rest of the year in the fast growing market of wearables. Feel free to share this post and your view on any of the topics mentioned above."}, {"author": "Yasi Baiani", "headline": "The Future of Wearables: Will They Die or Thrive?", "body": "[In the last few months, many friends and colleagues asked me about my view on the future of the wearable market. They wonder if the glorious days are over for the current wearable makers with bigger players coming to the market. I decided to share my thoughts here with you all.]\n\nWhat wearables have enabled is simple yet fascinating! Wearables have empowered us to discover more about our bodies and allowed us to quantify ourselves by monitoring our health, mood, performance, happiness, and actions 24/7. These are captivating phenomena that have become a reality through wearables. This is just the beginning, and it is by no means an end. In fact, the global wearable computing market will grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 43%, from $5 billion in 2013 to $9 billion in 2014 and over $30 billion in 2018!\nWhat follows are my predictions for how the wearables industry will trend. My view is based on analysis and observation of market demand, customer feedback, and user behavior:\n1) One versus multiple winners: At the Health 2.0 Conference a few weeks ago, I had the opportunity of picking Vinod Khosla\u2019s brain. When I asked him about the future of wearables, he said, \u201cThere is not one-size-fits-all when it comes to wearables.\u201d He is absolutely right!\nUltimately there will be more than one major player in the wearables market. Based on my research and data collection from wearable users, consumers seem to have a wide range of preferences in terms of both the design and the use-case of wearable devices. Some admire products like Fitbit that are simple and mainly focus on health and wellness offerings. Others prefer products like Pebble or Moto 360 that are in fact an extension of their mobile phones. Smart clothing is also getting some traction. With a wide range of quantified-self products displayed in this year\u2019s New York Fashion Week including the Ralph Lauren Polo Tech Shirt empowered by Omsignal\u2019s technology, this category will clearly have its own clientele.\n2) Smart versus intelligent devices: Despite the fact that we call the existing wearables \u201csmart devices,\u201d most of these products are not actually that intelligent. What most of these devices currently do is collect data about your steps, weight, heart rate, and calorie intake without much intelligence on top of it to make the data meaningful and actionable.\nCurrent wearables are not able to give you relevant feedback or provide you with useful tips for a healthier and more active lifestyle. The future generations of smart devices will in fact be able to change behaviors. Imagine a device that, as soon as you reach out for chips, notifies you that \u201cThis has 5x more carbohydrates and 35x more fat than carrot sticks (based on 100 grams of each). Do you want to substitute your snack?\u201d Envision a wearable that buzzes when you\u2019ve been sitting for the last 3 hours and encourages you to either go for a walk or at least stand up at your desk. These are smart devices that are truly intelligent and can lead behavioral change.\n3) Everyday products versus single-solution providers: The wearable market will eventually divide into two categories: 1) every day products and 2) single-solution products. Products like Fitbit fitness trackers, Apple Watch, and Samsung Galaxy Gear will fall into the first category. Over time they will continue to become more sophisticated with more functions packed into a single device.\nOn the other hand, there will be a significant market for single-solution products that solve one problem really well and will be appealing to a specific group of users. For instance, pregnancy monitoring products will be in high demand, but they will be only attractive to pregnant women and only for a period of time \u2013 during their pregnancy. Zepp is another example of a single-solution provider. It allows tennis or baseball players to analyze their swings; while this is a useful product for a certain group of users, it is not for everyone or for everyday, all day usage.\n4) Software versus hardware: Some argue that the future of wearables is in software and the hardware piece will eventually become commodity. I would argue that there are tremendous opportunities in both areas. As the wearable industry matures, it will become obvious who the market leaders will be -- currently it\u2019s Fitbit with ~70% market share. This will not only create opportunities for many developers/entrepreneurs to develop valuable applications on the winning platforms and build new businesses around it, but it will also substantially increase the value of the wearables to their users. A good analogy to this is the emergence of smart phones and the many app companies that built billion-dollar businesses around mobile (e.g. Instagram, WhatsApp). We will see history repeats itself for wearables.\nIn addition to applications for wearables, there are other emerging software products that will have significant impact in the industry. These players aim to be a centralized location for all data collected by different wearables. They want to make the collected metrics consistent -- independent of their sources -- and digestible by others such as physicians, coaches, employers, and insurance companies. Some players in this category include Apple\u2019s Healthkit and Jiff.\nThere is also tremendous opportunity to create breakthrough hardware pieces. On the health and wellness side, there is still room to build products that can more effectively track essential metrics such as glucose and stress levels. Also, an automatic food-monitoring device that can work in the background and track calorie intake without user entering any information will become a reality at one point. Additionally, as a prominent investor and entrepreneur, Bobby Yazdani, told me, \u201cThere are significant market opportunities for enterprise wearables. Think of what you can do if you have wearables integrated to business processes and support business and employee productivity.\u201d The opportunities on the hardware side could only increase as we find new ways to use them.\nAll these possibilities and examples testify to the fact that we are just at the tipping point of quantified-self market and that there will be tremendous opportunities ahead. This is also reflected in the Gartner 2014 Hype Cycle for Emerging Technologies report, where they predict that the wearable industry will continue to bloom in the next five to ten years.\nIf you are a wearable maker, go after it fast and furious. If you are a wearable user, please share your needs and insights, so that these companies could build the next generation of what you wish to see."}, {"author": "Yasi Baiani", "headline": "Can You Be A Rockstar Product Manager?", "body": "As Marc Andreessen said: \u201cSoftware is eating the world.\u201d With more and more businesses moving online, there\u2019s an ever-growing demand for talented designers and developers to design and build the best products. There\u2019s also a critical need for solid product managers (PMs) to determine what products and features to build. Product management has become that sexy role in the Valley and elsewhere. In fact, many top tech companies\u2019 CEOs have previously been highly respected product people (e.g. Marisa Mayer, CEO of Yahoo; Jack Dorsey, Founder of Twitter & Square).\nThe product manager is the liaison between the customer voice and the technical team. She understands and speaks the languages of the developers and designers. She is a bridge between the market and the product. She is the reality between customer needs and technical possibilities (and challenges).\nYou may wonder if the product manager role is right for you. Below, we lay out the main responsibilities of a PM and what attributes make a top 1% PM:\n1) Comprehends markets and customer needs: The PM\u2019s ability to empathize with customers and understand their needs \u2013 as well as the competitive landscape \u2013 is a PM\u2019s most crucial skill. Everyone in the company relies on the PM\u2019s clear understanding of customer needs (via research, surveys, and interviews) and the succinct communication of those needs (via user stories). Read Steve Blank\u2019s \u201cThe Four Steps to the Epiphany\u201d book to help you understand and implement these techniques.\n2) Gets things done through leadership, influence and adaptability: One of the most important responsibilities of a PM is to make things happen and ship the product. But how? You need to work closely with the different stakeholders in the company to understand their interests, their resources, and their constraints. Then, you must synchronize efforts from various groups to reach the main goal: shipping the product. Frequently, resource gaps will exist and the PM needs to get the priorities straight in order to direct the team in the right direction. To achieve the right balance, your leadership skills, your decision making capabilities, and the power of influence will all come into play.\n3) Team player and enjoys working cross-functionally: The product manager role is one of the most cross-functional jobs in a company. As a product manager, you\u2019ll spend the majority of your time working with engineers and designers. However, you\u2019ll also work closely with the QA, marketing, sales, legal, and executive teams. A superb PM will be a great team player, comfortable being stretched in many different directions, and managing different parties\u2019 expectations. They know that there is only one way to win: \u201cas a team\u201d.\n4) Understands and advocates great design: The necessity for simple, slick, and beautiful design is becoming ever more critical. With so many alternative products out there, users\u2019 tolerance for underwhelming, confusing products is diminishing. Thus, building a product that has the minimum functionality required to meet customers\u2019 needs and is user friendly should be on top of any company\u2019s priorities list. As a PM, you\u2019ll often have significant influence on design decisions. Let yourself and your product stand out by making the best design choices.\n5) Solid understanding of technology: It\u2019s a given that, as the product owner, the PM needs to understand the ins and outs of her product. A solid understanding of front-end and back-end technology empowers a PM to make better product decisions and lead the team to better outcomes, faster. It also helps to gain trust from your engineering team (without which, your life as a PM will be significantly more difficult). However, this doesn\u2019t mean that every PM needs to have a CS background or technical PhD; there are many awesome companies that hire non-technical PMs to work on really cool products.\nIf you don\u2019t have a technical background, we recommend getting your hands dirty by learning some coding. There are fabulous online sources such as Codeacademy, Khan Academy, Udacity, Udemy, and TreeHouse. You can start with HTML, CSS, Java, Python or Ruby on Rails.\nMost probably, your goal won\u2019t be to become a hardcore developer. Rather, it will likely be to understand \u2013 even at a high level \u2013 the technologies underlying the products you\u2019re building. This will enable you to ask the right questions to make the right decisions \u2013 even when you don\u2019t have a deep understanding of the specifics \u2013 and give you a huge leg up as a PM.\n6) Visionary: Although it\u2019s important to listen to your customers, an effective PM has a clear vision of where to take the product over the short and long term. If you ask customers what they need and build just for that, you may end up with the situation described by Henry Ford (Founder of Ford Automobile Company): \u201cIf I had asked people what they wanted, they would have said faster horses.\u201d\n7) Analytical and data driven: Some PM roles are more analytical than others. However, any solid PM should use data to drive product decisions. Tracking the right metrics, analyzing them, digging deeper, and finding out why numbers behave as they do are essential skills for a PM. But, combining these with vision and intuition make a PM a truly top player.\n8) Absorbs and remembers significant amounts of details: As a PM you\u2019ll spend the majority of your time in meetings, in which all sorts of information are provided to you from various sources. There are a lot of moving pieces in the development process. As you receive more information from customers about their needs or from developers about unexpected technical challenges, you need to constantly make big decisions. As a competent PM, it\u2019s important to absorb and process a lot of information and apply the details provided to you at any given time in an appropriate manner.\nUltimately, the bread and butter of any company are its products; helping to build those products as a product manager is a high-responsibility role. If you think what\u2019s described above matches your strengths \u2013 and what\u2019s expected of an A-Player PM makes you tick \u2013 then you may want to explore product management opportunities. We also recommend that you read \u201cWhat Distinguishes The Top 1% of Product Mangers From the Top 10%\u201d. If you are a PM, please share your view with us. If you are considering the PM career route, let us know if this helped shed some light on the PM\u2019s role and responsibilities.\nBy: Yasi Baiani, Product Manager @ athenahealth & Matthew Jaffe, Product Manager @ Dropbox. This Blog Post was also published on The Harvard Business School Student Magazine."}, {"author": "Yasi Baiani", "headline": "3 Digital Health Categories That Will Transform Healthcare Forever", "body": "The patient-centric health approach is an inevitable evolution in the healthcare industry that is happening faster than expected. Recent changes in regulations, coupled with new technological advancements and the speedy adoption by caregivers and patients of these new technologies, have created an infinite amount of opportunities for disrupting and ultimately improving the healthcare industry.\nBelow are three categories of digital health startups that rightfully put patients at the center of their business and build products and services that serve unmet patient needs:\n1) Telemedicine Services: Telemedicine is modernizing healthcare. Companies such as Doctor on Demand, which connects patients to physicians via mobile or web video chat, and First Opinion, which matches patients with doctors for unlimited medical text messaging, deliver healthcare services to broader groups. These companies are democratizing medicine by eliminating limitations of distance to a doctor\u2019s office, difficulty of scheduling an appointment, and high costs of doctor visits. Telemedicine companies enable 24/7 access to doctors for primary health issues. That is a powerful disruption to the healthcare industry!\nThese telemedicine companies each offer slightly different services and are priced differently. Doctor on Demand offers video calls with doctors and charges $40 per session. This price is on par with most insurance co-pays and cheaper than most urgent care as stated by Adam Jackson, the Co-Founder and CEO of Doctor on Demand. First Opinion\u2019s texting service is free for all unless you desire a response from a doctor under 5 minutes, in which case you can upgrade and subscribe to the premium version for $9 per month.\n\u201cThere are 1.2 billion ambulatory care visits every year, and the vast majority of people are walking in for something like colds or urinary tract infections that are very amenable to an initial consult over video,\u201d says Adam Jackson. If telemedicine companies could decrease these visits by 10-30%, there would be significant cost saving for the healthcare system and much time saving for patients.\n2) Digital Therapeutic Solutions: Whereas telemedicine companies want to offer quick access to doctors for basic health questions, digital therapeutic companies aim to bring medicine to your home to address more chronic health issues (e.g. diabetes, depression, back pain) and permanent behavioral changes. Digital therapeutic companies utilize mobile and web technologies to bring clinically proven programs to patients more conveniently and cost effectively. Most of these companies also have a coaching system in place to help patients stick to their programs.\nAs Sean Duffy, the CEO and Co-Founder of Omada Health, finds that for any digital therapeutic to be clinically meaningful, the provider needs to clear two significant hurdles. One, the provider needs to genuinely engage and inspire the patient, both initially and over time. Two, the provider must unequivocally demonstrate efficacy of its programs to the medical community by rooting itself in the best science and by producing clinically-significant outcomes.\nOmada, which raised $23 million Led by Andreessen Horowitz, is a pioneer in digital therapeutic solutions, offering a 16-week web-based program combined with coaching for pre-diabetes individuals. Another company in this category is ThriveOn, which offers 8 to 12 week personalized programs that are based on cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) to users with mental health issues. Other companies such as Reflection Health have reimagined physical therapy by offering customized programs and interactive online tools to make physical rehabilitation engaging, effective, and affordable.\n3) Patient Engagement Portals: Engaging and educating patients beyond a doctor visit or post-surgery has become an important topic in the healthcare system. The goal is to offer tools and technologies that facilitate communication with patients beyond the hospital environment, educate them about their health situation, empower them to stick to their medications and diet, and help them monitor their recovery.\nDue to the Affordable Care Act, the 30-day readmission rate has become a significantly more important figure for health centers and hospital executives to monitor and manage. Prior to this, hospitals were paid piecemeal for every admission and procedure during patients' stays. Now hospitals are penalized when patients return within 30 days for the same problem or because of a complication from their previous stay.\nAs a result, many health providers have started using technology to address patients\u2019 needs after an operation or after an office visit with their physician. Startups that are offering patient engagement tools and technologies include: HealthLoop, Self Health Network, and Wellframe.\nThe companies in the three categories above will be changing the relationship between patients and their physicians, care teams, and hospitals forever. I\u2019m curious to hear your insight and opinion about the points above and your experience using any of these services. Please share your view below."}, {"author": "Yasi Baiani", "headline": "Apple Watch Looks Great, But Didn\u2019t Impress the Health Community", "body": "The newest addition to the wearables market, eagerly anticipated and much-discussed, was just unveiled. Apple Watch is now here. Although there are a lot of things to admire about the product, the health community is lingering and wondering what happened to the \u201chealth features\u201d on Apple Watch?\nOn the positive side, the design and user interface were definitely awe-inspiring, but we didn\u2019t really expect much less from Apple, the powerhouse of design. The hardware looks elegant, and the Digital Crown beautifully enables smooth navigation within a small area. Variety won\u2019t be a problem with Apple Watch. With 2 million customizable faces, 2 case sizes, 34 wristband options, and 3 watch models (Apple Watch, Apple Watch Sport, and Apple Watch Edition), we are confident that everyone can find a style that they like.\nHowever, taking a closer look at the health and fitness features of the product has left us less excited about Apple Watch. Although Tim Cook claimed that Apple Watch is the most accurate and revolutionary fitness tracker in terms of functionalities, we find that it\u2019s more or less similar to other fitness trackers on the market (e.g., tracking calories burned or steps taken, cheering you when hitting your daily goals, etc.). One could argue that because of its heart rate and pulse monitoring capabilities, Apple Watch can measure the intensity of workouts and more accurately show the wearer\u2019s activity level. Having all these monitoring sensors in a single device definitely could improve the accuracy of metrics collected by Apple Watch. However, this still doesn\u2019t make us feel that the product is revolutionary, given that there are many other heart rate monitoring wearables already on the market.\nA few design points and functionalities do distinguish Apple Watch\u2019s fitness offerings from others on the market. These are some that came to our attention:\nBy displaying different rings for moving, exercising, and standing, Apple Watch can distinguish between the time you may be gardening and moving your hands/body versus doing cardio workouts.\nApple Watch can automatically re-adjust your activity goals based on your previous history.\nApple Watch tracks the number of minutes per day you stand up, with the goal to motivate you to be less sedentary during the day.\nApple Watch allows you to record and share your heartbeat with a friend.\nApple Watch captures the intensity of your workout, although this claim is best verified when we can test the actual product.\nApple Watch beautifully displays an informative and detailed view of your monthly activities in a glance (see image below).\nWith all the buzz around Apple\u2019s health initiatives, Healthbook and HealthKit, we were also expecting to see more remarkable \u201chealth\u201d features on Apple Watch. Based on what Apple has revealed, Apple Watch doesn\u2019t seem to be capable of measuring blood pressure, hydration, oxygen saturation, blood sugar, or many of the other health metrics Healthbook is supposed to display. These critical health metrics were in fact exactly the type of information that many of us in the health and wearable community were hoping to see in Apple Watch. Does this mean that Apple will fully rely on third party apps/products to collect and share these metrics? Or is this simply the first generation, a work-in-progress that will be improved upon in future versions of Apple wearables? Health metrics like these would allow Apple Watch to create significant health value and substantially distinguish itself from anything like it in the market.\nWe will continue staying optimistic and hope to see some more sophisticated health and fitness functionalities in future Apple wearables."}, {"author": "Yasi Baiani", "headline": "6 Important Product, Design and Strategic Decisions For Wearable Makers", "body": "It is a super exciting time for wearable entrepreneurs! The early generation of wearables has offered a promising step towards what could be achieved over time with the new generation of wearable products.\nThe wearable industry is still in its infancy. Although wearable makers have spent significant effort to marry hardware and software technologies and build cool products, there is still a lot to be discovered, learned, and applied in this industry.\nAs a wearable maker, there are six elements to consider and successfully navigate in order to build a winning product that will be adopted by the majority of the population:\n1) How to impact without too much disruption? For wearables to be successful, they need to change behavior and improve outcomes without too much disruption in the user\u2019s lifestyle.\nThink of health and fitness bands - if they cannot help users become more active, they will fail to provide much value. On the other hand, if they interrupt the user\u2019s daily behaviors too much (with notifications or other nudging mechanisms), users may get uncomfortable and resist using the device all together. Having an impact on user behavior and lifestyle in a smooth and subtle way is the key for success.\n2) Do you make your wearable fashionable or invisible? As wearable makers evaluating design decisions, they wonder if their products should be trendy and fashionable or invisible and subtle.\nObserving the market leaders\u2019 moves signals that they bet on the former. Fitbit partnered with Tory Burch to design next generation of wearables, Apple hired the former CEOs of both YSL and Burberry for its wearable efforts, and Google partnered with Diane Von Furstenberg to design new Google Glass frames. On the other hand, another group of companies put their efforts into designing invisible patches and sensors.\nAt this point, we are at the very early stages of the wearable era; only time and more data about use cases of wearables will verify or nullify some of the early design assumptions.\n3) Where is the best spot on the body for wearables? So far the wrist has been a winning spot for wearables. BI Research projected that in the next five years, 70% of wearable shipments will be smart wristwears. Many health & fitness bands including Fitbit, Jawbone, and Sony SmartBand, as well as smartwatches such as Pebble, Basis, Moto 360, LG G watch, and Samsung\u2019s Gear Live, chose the wrist versus other parts of body for their products.\nHowever, the question many wearable makers are still trying to answer is if there are better places for wearables on or even inside the body. Some believe having wearables on the waist, inside ears, or under the skin would provide more accurate information. Others argue that the finger might be the best place, particularly for gesture-controlling wearables (e.g., Nod). At this point, many wearable makers seem to be experimenting with different options in search of the best solution.\n4) How do you address battery life of your product? Users don\u2019t like the mental burden of charging their wearables on a weekly basis. They view it as a disruption to their daily routine and report it as one of the main reasons to abandon their devices. Knowing this, it\u2019s critical to make the charging process as frictionless as possible. Analysis by Credit Suisse expects that battery constrains will force more computation intensive activities to run on smartphones rather than on wearables.\nBased on an IHS report, lithium polymer batteries will take the predominant share -- 73% of total -- of wearables\u2019 battery revenue. That\u2019s because they are lighter and can be manufactured into a wider range of shapes and sizes, compared to traditional lithium-ion batteries. If you have to guess, what would be your projection of the winning battery type for future wearables?\n5) What are your privacy beliefs and guidelines? People hold a variety of opinions when it comes to privacy standards. Many come to believe that there is no privacy in this day and age. Entrepreneurs like Larry Page wish to make health data public. Others are concerned about the possible privacy nightmares in the world of wearables and connected devices.\nAs the FDA recently loosened up regulations on tracking devices and health apps, entrepreneurs in these fields got excited about the opportunities ahead. However, privacy advocates are utterly distressed! Their concern is that consumers may not be aware of the type or scale of data being collected about them. With increase in Internet-connected devices, companies would gain unfair advantage over consumers, knowing very detailed information about their personal life, activities, and behaviors.\nAs a wearable maker you can take a few steps to build trust with your users:\nFind out your privacy beliefs as a company\nBe transparent about your security and privacy rules\nClearly mention what your policies are regarding connecting and sharing data with other applications and products\nEnsure your technological architecture can deliver what you promise in terms of security and privacy controls\nStay accountable to your terms of service and your privacy policy\n6) What\u2019s your distribution strategy? Over 250 wearable companies presented their products at CES in early 2014. The number of wearable companies will continue to increase as more entrepreneurs and innovators see opportunity in this category. The critical question is which brands and products will outlast others and become the product of choice by the majority.\nPart of the challenge for wearable companies would be to get their products in the hands of users in the first place. That means a race for distribution. A few factors make distribution substantially harder for small players:\nApple\u2019s and Google\u2019s existing distribution channels\nLarge companies\u2019 existing and loyal customer base\nCommitted group of developers who will build independent apps for only iOS and Android platforms\nThe possibility that, over time, wearables will become accessory devices for mobile products, thus giving advantage to Android with over 1.1 billion smartphones\nAs a wearable maker, try to address these issues and think about them early and strategically. Having a solid response to these questions will empower you to differentiate your company and product in this crowded and competitive market."}, {"author": "Yasi Baiani", "headline": "What Wearables 2.0 Should Focus On", "body": "The wearable market is exploding! The notion of quantified-self and the desire for data collection about our bodies and behaviors have become so important and valuable that many entrepreneurs and established companies have devoted a lot of resources to build products to address these needs.\nFitbit, with over 67% of the market share in 2013, has been by far the leader in the wearable market. Apple just launched its HealthKit, which aims to connect the world of health from multiple dimensions by facilitating the accumulation and access to the health data. Salesforce bet on wearables by launching its Salesforce Wear Developer Pack to enable developers to build applications for a variety of wearable devices. Google, Facebook, Samsung, Motorola, and LG all have joined the wearable party!\nAlthough most of these wearables will end up offering various functions (e.g. taking pictures, receiving text messages, pushing relevant information to user) the \u201chealth\u201d offering will be by far the most revolutionizing and important component of all successful wearable devices. That\u2019s why companies like Apple and Google made big bets, hiring top influencers of the healthcare industry to lead their health and wearable initiatives. Given that, the question becomes what does a wearable 2.0 need to offer in order to be a winning wearable product?\nBelow are some of the most important factors that wearable 2.0 companies need to focus on:\n1) Provide More Accurate Data: Many skeptics of wearables 1.0 rightfully question the accuracy of data collected by the monitoring devices. Even the basic information tracked by wearables 1.0, such as steps taken or calories burned, is not really accurate. For instance, if you do bikram yoga and burn about 450 calories, your Fitbit or Jawbone wristbands won\u2019t capture any of that.\nBecause of their lack of accuracy, wearables 1.0 failed to establish trust with mass population and can\u2019t yet be confidently used by physicians and care providers for medical decisions. Aggregating accurate data that could be used for preventive care and diagnosis is a much harder, yet much more important nut to crack! Offering more accurate metrics is the first step for wearables 2.0 to establish trust with those who want to quantify themselves (users) and those who want to quantify others (physicians or coaches).\n2) Offer More About Health Than Only Fitness: Most of the current fitness trackers collect information about the number of steps taken, calories burned, and duration of high intensity workouts. Some of them like Fitbit and Jawbone also track your sleep and allow you to manually keep track of your food intake.\nAlthough these might have been interesting metrics to offer for wearables 1.0, they won\u2019t be enough for wearable 2.0 products! Wearables should move beyond fitness and focus more on health. They need to track more biometrics and health metrics such as glucose level, oxygen saturation, heart-rate, heart rhythm, respiration rate, blood pressure, temperature, cortisol level, and adrenaline level to better demonstrate an individual\u2019s health status at any given time. Being able to provide a 24/7 health snapshot of an individual will be invaluable and make a much more compelling usecase for the wearable 2.0 devices.\n3) Offer Tools That Make Data \u201cActionable\u201d: Collecting all of these health metrics alone won\u2019t be that useful. Being able to make the accumulated data digestible, comparable, and actionable is what wearable 2.0 companies should focus on. Research shows that \u2153 of wearable owners depart their devices within the first 6 months. Based on my interviews with many of these users, I learned that they expect their wearables not only track their health and activity metrics, but also help them to improve those numbers. For wearable 2.0 makers to succeed:\n- They should classify collected data from people of the same age, gender, and health profiles and create indexes.\n- Then, they should provide those indexes to users, so that each user could compare his performance relative to others in the same category.\n- Finally, they should incorporate features and levers in the product that encourage everyone to be at their best and improve from their baseline.\n4) Integrate Into the Healthcare System: For wearables 2.0 to have real impact, they need to be integrated into the healthcare system. Collecting more health metrics and more accurate data are definitely right steps towards building trust and credibility with physicians and care providers. In order to widely penetrate into the healthcare system and become part of a doctor\u2019s daily workflow, wearable 2.0 makers should focus on two things:\n- Establish partnership with existing technologies and systems in hospitals and physicians\u2019 offices. Great examples of such partnerships are Apple\u2019s integration with Epic and the Mayo Clinic. We need more of these in order to have a win-win-win situation for users/patients, wearable makers, and care providers.\n- Offer features that address care providers\u2019 needs (e.g. a dashboard with charts and tables to easily demonstrate a user\u2019s health metrics).\nWearables are and will be one of the most disruptive and exciting phenomena of our era! In addition to the points mentioned above, there are a few other elements that wearables 2.0 should get right in order to become the desired product everyone wants to wear 24/7. These elements include the design, privacy factors, battery life, and all-in-one-device offering. I\u2019m looking forward to seeing the next generations of wearables evolve rapidly to empower us with an amazing amount of information about ourselves and offer us exceptional user experience."}][{"author": "Louis M. Profeta MD", "headline": "God May Make You Explain Why You Skipped Your High School Reunion", "body": "I had a brief crush on her in high school. Which, for me, meant I just kind of stared at her from across the room for half a semester during third period. I don\u2019t think I ever said three words to her in my entire life. I did tell her dad she had died, though.\nAt the time, I didn\u2019t even realize it was her. Up until that point she was \u201cthe cardiac arrest in room 38,\u201d until it hit me square in my throat after I heard her name. I put the chart down, took a deep breath and slowly eased the door back open then softly closed it behind me as if I was trying not to disturb her. I gently pulled back the sheet from just under her eyes and brushed her hair from across her face hoping there was some mistake. There wasn\u2019t. It was her \u2026 it was her. I briefly recall thinking that I wish I had spoken more than a few words to her in history class. I told her I was sorry that I couldn\u2019t have helped and I left to tell her father the horrible news. Come to think of it, it may have been fourth period history class, if I remember it correctly.\nFor more than 25 years, I\u2019ve been privileged to practice emergency medicine at a Level 1 trauma center just a couple miles down the street from my alma mater, North Central High School, class of 1982 ... GO PANTHERS. I graduated with more than 1,000 students. So, in many ways, since about 1990, I have been experiencing a high school reunion of sorts, caring for classmates, teachers and their families and countless others linked to that four-year expedition through adolescence. Blessed and humbled by the successes and sadly haunted at times by the failures, I\u2019m still always amazed at how each of us change physically, mentally, emotionally and spiritually as we age and how often I\u2019m left thinking:\n\u201cI wish I had known them better in high school. I wish I had said more than a few words to them when we were kids.\u201d\nSome of us gloss over a reunion notice as nothing more than an invitation to some Friday night gathering we might attend if we are in town, but there is a reason why high school reunions evoke so much visceral emotion with so many of us. It is a four-year snapshot of the most formative, terrifying and confusing years of our lives. It is a one-acre photo riddled with imagery and emotion, heartbreak, elation, cattiness, anger, success, failure, friendship, loneliness and every single feeling that can rain down, like a Texas hailstorm, upon the frail head of a teenager. So much of it we would like to forget and so much more we in time hope we could hold on to forever. As those five and ten year milestones are reached, we quickly come to realize that no matter how worldly and self-aware we thought we were then, we didn\u2019t know shit at sixteen, seventeen or eighteen. We were simply children in grown up bodies.\nIf I hand you a photo when you were 18, taken of yourself in sixth grade, perhaps just one of those \u2018hanging around in the basement with a couple of friends\u2019 kind of snapshots you\u2019d probably say something like: \u201cI can\u2019t believe my mom cut my hair like that and sent me to school wearing that horrible sweater. I look awful.\u201d\nIf I showed you that same picture when you were 20, a couple years of college or the military or life in the real world under your belt, you\u2019d peer at it perhaps behind a hint of a smile and say, \u201cIkk\u2026my hair, my teeth. I kind of liked that sweater though.\u201d\nIf I showed you that photo when you were 40, you\u2019d pause and look past it as if you were simply holding vapor and say to yourself: \u201cMy children are the same age as I was in this photo. My god we were young.\u201d\nIf I showed you that picture when you were 50, you\u2019d look at it, slowly caress the edges, sniff the paper, think about the friends in the photo and briefly try to recall the exact day it was taken, then slowly lay the picture back down and say to yourself: \u201cThose were great friends to have as a kid; I wonder whatever happened to that sweater. I should call her, catch up.\u201d\nNow of course if I showed you that photo when you were 85, you\u2019d look at it and say: \u201cThose were damn fine clothes we wore back then, nobody appreciates good sweaters anymore, all that crap people wear now a days. No self-respect.\u201d Trust me when I tell you that you would also be damn blessed if you could remember the names of the other people in the photo, too.\nThe snapshot is frozen but our eyes change minute to minute. Our experiences change how we view the world at any given time and that includes those kids you were \"forced\" to spend four years with, those kids you might have loathed, found petty or hated.\nThe reunion however gives you a chance to pass the photo around and see it with new eyes.\nMost of us are keenly aware that there are horrible and heart-wrenching reasons one may never want to open those high school pages again, but even people who have experienced the worst imaginable tragedies in history \u2014 from crime to war to sickness \u2014 often eventually make it back to the place they escaped from and found themselves glad they did. Fortunately, very few of us carry that kind of emotional burden in regards to how we envision our high school years. And, if there are those in our class that do, then it behooves us even more to at least try to bring them back into the fold and make it right for them, offer them peace and closure and tell them: \"We\u2019re sorry, we should have acted differently.\"\nEither way, each of us in a sense are stockholders of the history of a four year block of time, under one building, in one location, with one group of people who for better or worse shared a collective experience. It\u2019s also a history that will fade with the final passing of the last graduate. Reunions help remind us of that we were just kids back then. In a way they allow us a chance to laugh at ourselves, forgive ourselves and more importantly forgive others.\nSo you \u201chated high school\u201d and you \u201chated those kids\u201d and you swore you\u2019d never go back. Just go, even for a few minutes, say hello to one person you haven\u2019t seen in 20 years. Say a kind word no matter how small, some fleeting memory you had of someone that for some reason stuck with you all these years. Perhaps tell a classmate you are sorry, give someone else the chance to say the same to you. Go in with the idea that maybe it\u2019s not all about you, but about the collective \"us\" too.\nIn a world in which everything is recorded and archived, it\u2019s kind of nice knowing that we create with our group memories this nostalgia sand castle built by each of our hands, then sit back and watch it sink back into the sea.\nMost of us left high school with a bag of emotional pebbles and stood on the shore and tossed them into the water and said, \u201cGoodbye, good riddance, to hell with all of you, I\u2019m out of here.\u201d We watched the ripples fan out across the water and fade to glass.\nPerhaps this year, though, you go to the reunion. It\u2019s a Friday night chance to pull the pebble from the water and see the ripples in reverse ... and just perhaps give you a chance to say a kind word or a simple hello to the boy or girl who you barely knew, and never spoke to, who sat across from you in history class.\nDr. Louis M.

I\u2019m talking about the great big compacted, rain-soaked, sun-baked kind of dirt pile, replete with discarded pieces of construction scraps, chunks of concrete, a beer can or two and some good old-fashioned roofing nails capable of putting the eye out of a sperm whale. That pile of dirt: the dirt of new sewer lines, the dirt of room additions, the dirt that made any backhoe a thing of legend to every kid in the neighborhood.\nIf you grew up anywhere in America, especially around 1970s or '80s, then you know exactly what I am talking about. Because in the era preceding the step-by-step Lego \"model\" generation, the battery operated toy generation, the Call of Duty, Xbox and Nintendo generation, the generation of play dates and parental warning stickers, there existed an attractive nuisance of such awe-inspiring captivation it rivaled Disneyland\u2026 the pile of dirt.\nA pile of dirt, a shoebox filled with Hot Wheels and Matchbox cars, a can of GI Joes (the tiny plastic ones with their feet melted together) and a couple scraps of wood and you had it all. You were a general, an off-road racer, a God. You made avalanches, jumped Grand Canyon-sized ravines, and rolled and crashed cars with such reckless abandonment that rumor had it Ralph Nader was thinking of banning you from grade school. You dug rivers, built forests and caves and mountains. You burned plastic soldiers with stolen matches that once lit Lucky Strikes, in a battle for hilltop supremacy. Barbie dolls with torn-out hair and chewed up feet became unwilling pedestrians of reckless drivers in two-inch-long '67 Mustangs whose tires were bent and hoods would no longer close. \nYou built ramps, dug tunnels, made cities and forts. You caked your nails with so much dirt that your teeth would grate on the grit as you ate your peanut butter sandwiches with the crusts still on. Banana seated orange Schwinn stingrays launched across the mounds in aerial acrobatics clearing entire armies and fortresses of those green plastic soldiers, sun-bleached Lincoln logs, parking lots of the colored corvettes and the shattered remnants of the Malibu Barbie beach house which now littered the landscape. Minutes became hours and hours became days and time took its toll as the constant digging, the rain, the sun, the bikes changed the pile into a firm, rounded breast, then a flattened, clay-grey spot, then a patch of weeds and finally fading into the memory of the lawn. \nWhat ever happened to the big pile of dirt? How sad, the closest most of us will ever again get to this thing of beauty is looking at it from below. When a child, who stumbles upon it, is brought into the ER covered in mud, a laceration on his brow or a wrist slightly bent, all I can do is smile and think to myself:\n\"Good for you kid, good for you.\"\nDr. Louis M.

You might be putting on a set of brakes, or finishing up installing an air bag or anchoring down the final assembly of a seatbelt. You might be looking up at the clock and thinking about quitting time or perhaps the soccer game your kid will be playing this upcoming weekend. You might be having a good day or a bad day or perhaps just one of those \u2018days\u2019 that melts into the next and into the next. You most likely will not be thinking for a minute that what you do right now will save my life or years down the line that of a six-year-old child dying of an allergic reaction. Confused? Let me explain\u2026and say thank you.\nMy name is Louis Profeta. I am an emergency physician in Indianapolis, Indiana. I think I have a pretty stressful job, that of an ER doc in a major metropolitan emergency room but who doesn\u2019t have a stressful job. I have been doing this a long time. It\u2019s an amazing profession, lots of rewards, sometimes magical, other times tragic. Like any job, you just have to sometimes, step back, just go somewhere, lie down and breathe. So I did just that.\nA friend of mine and I hopped a plane and headed for the Caribbean. I was so looking forward for a chance to just get away and relax for a few days in the Turks and Caicos Islands. I rented a late model Nissan Sunny at a bargain rate and settled down for a week of relaxation. \nI was not on the island for five hours when I was involved in a head-on collision with a truck at nearly 40 miles an hour. The impact was incredible, but the breaks slowed the car, the seatbelt held, and the air bags deployed. I suffered rib fractures, a sternal fracture, two broken fingers and multiple bruises. My friend suffered a broken arm, multiple severe lacerations and some minor internal injuries. While he was trapped, I stumbled from the car and lay dying (or so I thought) on the side of the road. The pain was incomprehensible and I could not breathe as I had hoped I would on this trip. I looked up at the dark sky, took one last breath and said \u201ctime to die.\u201d I made my peace with God and I waited ... and I waited. \nI am happy to say that after a long recovery both my buddy and I are doing great. I\u2019m even back to playing basketball. My kids and his kids still have fathers that can hug them and love them and our wives still have their husbands. I can\u2019t be any more forthright in my description than that. My partners in the ER look at the photos and can\u2019t help but get choked with tears since they know there is no way the occupants of that car survive that impact, but we did thanks to you. We in the ER know all too well. We see thousands of these photos that the paramedics bring to us attached to the gurneys of the injured and the dying. We know that whoever was in that photo in most all likelihood was killed. We weren\u2019t; we are still here.\nLast week, I was on my shift when a frantic mother rushed a child into the ER. It was one of the toughest cases I have had in years. She had a near fatal allergic reaction. I was performing CPR on this child in front of her parents. I had to put her on a breathing machine and dig deep into my years of training to save her. I am thrilled to say she survived and she did great. She went home today. But somewhere in the course of this event, while I was desperately trying to save this child, my mind flashed back to you, some worker in some Nissan plant, doing some job you might love or you might hate, who has no idea that what you are doing has such an amazing and spiritual impact on the world.  I just thought I needed to say thank you.\nSincerely,\nLouis M. Profeta MD\nDr. Louis M. Profeta is an emergency physician practicing in Indianapolis.

I had been by his side for nearly five months at that point, spending nearly every night in a chair next to his bed. Since he was stable and between the lulls of chemotherapy, I was finally able to get back to Indianapolis in order to work a few shifts in our emergency department. I needed to still make a living. \nTwo days in a row, my first two days back, I sat in the \u201cquiet room\u201d of our upscale suburban hospital, where we take families in order to tell them the worst news of their life.   \nTwo days in a row, I knelt down, took the hand of a woman my wife\u2019s age, one that was soft and manicured and looked as if it had never held a cigarette or dug a hole in the dirt, and said to her, \u201cYour child has died of a heroin overdose.\u201d\nTwo days in a row, I stared into the frozen half-opened eyes of the cold bodies that could just have easily been lounging in the family room of my own house, playing Madden NFL or Monopoly while sipping a tucked away beer and surfing Snapchat. Cold, dead, lying on the cots in front of me, they stared back and I fought with every ounce of my being not to jump into my car or hop a plane and immediately rush back to New York to be with my own son.\nYou see, heroin is now a middle-class disease, which sadly means one thing: People are finally taking notice.\nSure, you understand what I am saying. If I ask you to close your eyes and picture a heroin addict, chances are you see a wasting male, staggering in a fog, hair matted with dust, perhaps trying to panhandle a buck then copping a seat on a piece of cardboard behind an alley dumpster while tying a shoelace around his arm.\nIf I ask you to close your eyes and picture a heroin addict, you might see a burned out prostitute, makeup all askew, lipstick streaks to her chin, leaning into the window of an old sedan.\nIf I asked you to picture a heroin addict, you might see a couple fringed punk rockers or modern day Deadhead wannabes lying on some piss-covered mattress in a crack house, rubber bands, lit candles and spoons strewn on the floor.\nWhat you would not see is the face of some real estate agent on a Re/Max or Century 21 sign, searching through your medicine cabinet during an open house hoping to find a bottle of Vicodin or oxycodone all the while ensuring you that your home is in good hands.\nWhat you would not see is a member of the debate team, the Spanish club, the varsity singers, the third violin, or the second baseman popping an oxy left over from grandma\u2019s hip replacement and washing it down with a Blue Ribbon. What you would not see is the Junior League housewife, or the winner of the country club\u2019s men\u2019s division who became dependent on one of a dozen opiate narcotics prescribed for his wisdom teeth, ACL or lumbar fusion.\nThis is what my partners and I see in the daily flow of patients into our ER. Those dead, the near misses, those that breathe and beat but no longer think or respond to those who love them, the ones that will perhaps go on to give a liver or kidney to someone else now that they are no longer using them. It never used to be like this. We used to see one overdose a month perhaps. Not one a day.\nNow, it's a heartbreaking loop: the cast-down eyes of a mother of three, too embarrassed to look up. She stole a prescription pad, or was found passed out in the bathroom next to the copier machine; I can\u2019t remember which. Pain, anger, humiliation or even ambivalence are common in these cases. Some patients truly want help, while the majority just want out of the ER.

It\u2019s pretty much what every ER doc now sees.\nI hate to tell you, but heroin is now in the Hamptons, in the tree-lined cul-de-sacs of Highland Park, in boarding schools and SAT study groups of the \u201ctop-rated high school in all of the midwest.\u201d It\u2019s in all the places you\u2019ve moved to in order to escape those places you moved from.\nOvernight, heroin went from being a \u201ccrime\u201d of the wretched poor, minority class our \u201cenlightened\u201d minds envision to a \u201cdisease\u201d of the suburban elite. Funny how things like that happen. Baltimore has about 650,000 residents and nearly 50,000 heroin addicts. They have been fighting this battle for years. They are now looking at the rest of America and frustratingly saying to themselves: \u201cWhere in the hell have you been?\u201d\nLast year, overdoses on prescription opiates killed more than 15,000 people. Heroin overdoses killed another 13,000. That is one dead every 20 minutes. Last year alone, more than 2 million Americans abused or were dependent on opiate pain medications and every day more than 1,000 people will be treated in ERs for abusing prescription opiates. Nearly three out of four heroin users report abusing prescription pain medications prior to graduating to heroin. How many of us have these in our medicine cabinets? I bet for most of you the answer is: \u201cYes, but I only have a few leftover from when I had surgery.\u201d\nDr. Timothy Kelly, a noted addiction expert in our city, told me: \u201cIt only takes a few pills to start the addiction. What's more is how cheap heroin has become, often cheaper than a few cigarettes depending on the purity.\u201d It made me think. Maybe it\u2019s time then to start treating our pain pills more like firearms, keeping them out of reach and disposing of them when no longer needed.\nWhy are we more worried about gluten than heroin, processed corn syrup than oxycodone, peanuts than hydrocodone? Perhaps it\u2019s because we are afraid to cross that abyss and admit that heroin is now something that children of the middle and upper class should be warned about. Our state of mind in regards to heroin has largely been, \u201cI am as worried about heroin as I am my son or daughter will be eaten by a lion in my front yard.\u201d \n\u201cThis is the Hamptons, this is Highland Park, this is the best school district in the midwest with the highest SAT scores.\u201d\nAs an ER doc, let me be the one to tell you ... the lion is in your yard.\nDr. Louis M.

Soon we'll be able to transplant organs from different species", "body": "\"The creatures outside looked from pig to man, and from man to pig, and from pig to man again: but already it was impossible to say which was which.\"\n                                 George Orwell, Animal Farm, 1946\nIf you need a kidney transplant tomorrow, chances are you will wait around three years. Even before you get transplanted, assuming you live, you will most likely spend years on dialysis. Right now there are more than 100,000 people in the US waiting for kidney transplants. Every year nearly 5,000 people will die just waiting for one. On the horizon though, is a potential source of donors that may revolutionize kidney transplantation as we know it. Best of all, it may be that we only have to go to a local farm to get one.\nIn 1984 at Loma Linda University Medical Center an infant girl known as \"Baby Fae\" received the first xenotransplant, also known as non-human to human transplant. In this case, Baby Fae received a baboon heart in a last ditch effort to save her life. Sadly, Baby Fae died 21 days later. \nThe roadblock to success with this kind of therapy in transplantation has always been how best to keep you from rejecting your new organ. This is the cornerstone of the science whose goal is to best match your gift and to protect it for the remainder of what we hope will be your long life. This is essentially the same science that determines blood types and why we need to match blood donors with blood recipients.\nYou see, your body is able to recognize an unmatched transplanted organ such as a heart, kidney or liver, as not being your own. This recognition of the unmatched organs is triggered when certain proteins on their cells cause a cascade of biological processes in which your body mounts an attack on your newly transplanted organ. This leads to organ rejection and possibly even your death.\nThe ability to successfully transplant an organ is a product of two fundamental therapies. First we have find an organ from a donor whose proteins most closely look like yours, and second we have to protect that organ with medications meant to keep your immune system from attacking your new transplant. Even then the organ is often rejected, an incredible loss not only for you but for the family of the deceased or living donor who graciously tried to save your life.\nThe trouble with the Baby Fae case is that the heart of the baboon, while similar in size and structure to her own heart, simply did not look like her human heart on the cellular level. Fae\u2019s own immune system attacked the baboon heart and she died.\nOver the years since the early 80\u2019s there has been a resurgence in research the focus of which is to alter the cells of non-human species and ultimately make those cells resemble those of a human being. \nScientists have started to make huge inroads through cloning. The model that seems the most promising is not a primate such as a monkey, or chimp. Instead the animal that holds the most promise of all potential animal donors is of all things\u2026the pig.  Incredibly scientists have succeeded in removing those proteins from pig cells that are most responsible for rejection. In the simplest of explanations, these pig kidneys, on the cellular level are coming close to being indistinguishable from humans. They are so close in fact that they may not even need to be matched. You can essentially put the same kidney into\u2026well anybody.\nTransplant surgeon Dr. Joseph Tector, and his laboratory at the University of Alabama at Birmingham, is on the forefront of this scientific advancement. They are very close. So close in fact that I predict, for the coming year, that Dr. Tector will put the first pig kidney into a human being, possibly as early as the end of 2017, or the very beginning of 2018. I also predict this will work and change the way we think of organ transplantation forever. \nDown the line I envision huge cloning farms, producing the same pig over and over. Essentially a continuous and unlimited source of kidneys, so many in fact that we will probably need hospitals solely meant for kidney transplantation. In time I predict this process will eventually translate to livers, hearts, even intestines but for now the focus is on kidneys. I am excited to see what will happen in the near future and where we are headed. We just may be on the verge of one of the most significant advancements in medicine in the last fifty years.

Profeta MD", "headline": "These four words that may offend you ... may also just save you", "body": "\u201cWhat do you do for a living,\u201d the young man asked me.\n\u201cI\u2019m an emergency physician. How about you?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m just a chef,\u201d he replied.\n\u201cPal, I can live a lifetime without medicine. I can only live a week without food.\u201d\nSometimes a group a people you speak to love you. Other times, well \u2014 hate may be a bit strong, but they are far less enamored with what you have to say. This is a tale of the latter, and to tell you the truth, I\u2019m kind of proud of it.\nRecently, an incredibly inspiring physician invited me to speak at a conference, the central theme being burnout in medicine. I really thought I had a handle on this being that I had been practicing emergency medicine for nearly 25 years and I did not feel burned out, which as I just learned is way above the average for ER physicians who typically have a burnout rate of more than 50%. In fact, in our very large private physician group, the rate of burnout and attrition is, well, damn near close to zero. So why is that? What were we doing right? Certainly we are all very supportive of each other. We are all completely bogged down in electronic medical record keeping, seas of bureaucracy, fears of malpractice and other stressors including working far more hours than most other physicians in our specialty. What is it about us? I truly think it comes to four simple words that all of us have grown to embrace. Those words?\nIt\u2019s just a job.\nLet that sink in a bit because when I proposed that to this group of nurses, physicians and nurse practitioners, you would have thought I just stood up and proclaimed I was the antichrist. Even though I prefaced it during my talk by elaborating and saying that medicine is a deeply rewarding career choice, I insisted that it\u2019s not our life. I tried to express that it\u2019s simply a wonderful, marvelous and mystical avenue to allow us the opportunity to pursue meaningful work, make a good living, support our families and to do a job that allows us to see and do many magical things. I also said that I felt it was not a prerequisite to always practice with compassion. Compassion means to suffer with others. I proposed that we do not need to suffer. Our role is to be there, provide comfort, alleviate suffering, listen and be engaged. We don\u2019t HAVE to feel every bit of it viscerally but certainly there will be times where we truly connect and we will. But it\u2019s also OK when we don\u2019t. We don\u2019t have to take every single emotion home, internalize it and make it part of our being. Which, in today\u2019s society of rapid extrapolation, registered as:\n\u201cHe must not listen to his patients.\u201d\nI tried to explain that I feel our emotions wax and wane day-to-day and minute-to-minute. It does not mean for one second that we are incapable of providing excellent care during those times and that this emotional separation does keep you sane and helps prevent burnout and allows you to focus on your job.\nThat wasn\u2019t good enough for these attendees. In fact, one pretty much raised her hand, took the mic and said she was highly offended that I would say or even imply that medicine was just a job. She said she would not want to have a physician like me and there is no way that you can \u201cfake\u201d compassion. That\u2019s when Starbucks entered my brain.\nHow often does a barista smile at you, thank you and tell you to have a good day? How often do you walk away feeling good that he or she was so welcoming and friendly? How often do you know what happened to them last night, what news they got this morning, how much money is in their bank account, what their marriage is like? Let me help you out with the answer \u2026 pretty much never. So do you think that patients are any different than you in those moments? You smile, listen, stroke their hands and offer words of comfort. Do you think the patient pauses and asks themselves about what happened to you last night, how marriage is, what is going on in your life? They just want to feel comforted.\nOne attendee warmly smirked at me earlier at dinner. \n\u201cI just don\u2019t buy your assertion that it is just a job.\u201d She motioned to the bartender. \u201cLook, he just pours drinks and you say my job is no different than his?\u201d\nI tilted my glasses down and stared into her eyes.\n\u201cWhat if I told you that he works three jobs to support a disabled child at home and that this late-night job affords him the opportunity to buy her a few things that make her smile and feel special. Perhaps some toys he could otherwise not afford or a new dress perhaps. You think your job is so much better than his because you hold someone\u2019s hand when they are sick instead of passing a beer?\u201d\nI like to think she bowed her a head a bit in shame perhaps, but I\u2019m not so sure.\nAs the discussion went on that morning, a common theme emerged. Many of these people did not want suggestions on how to keep from being burned out. What they wanted was to be fawned over and congratulated on how compassionate they were, and how they had the hardest jobs in the world, and that no one could possibly understand the work or appreciate how hard their jobs were. I\u2019m sorry, I said. \u201cI just don\u2019t buy it. You invited me; I\u2019m not here to validate you. That has to come from within.\u201d\nYou see, I think we are a bit elitist as to how we view ourselves in medicine at times. Sure, this is a very hard job, charged with emotion; it leads to crying, heartbreak and nightmares on occasion. But it is also filled with incredible rewards both spiritually and even financially.\nOne speaker, who was a physician and also a faculty member at Duke\u2019s school of divinity, disagreed with my assertion and proposed that medicine was different, though. In a way, it was an embodiment of Christ\u2019s principals of healing and was perhaps the first real charitable endeavor. I turned to him and said something to the effect.\n\u201cYeah, that\u2019s all fine and dandy but if it weren\u2019t for the farmers, shepherds and fisherman during that time, the weak and infirm would just have been a source of protein.\u201d\nOne attendee lamented about caring for a patient who was recovering from a procedure that went against her own personal values. She said she was distressed and angered by this; I believe what she hoped for was for me to embrace her distress, validate it, provide words of comfort and support and give advice on how to change. Even though, mind you, she said the patient was happy and very comforted by her care. I looked at her and responded.\n\u201cSo what? That\u2019s your job. You are supposed to provide care regardless of your values.\u201d\nShe snapped at me.\n\u201cYeah, but what about me?\u201d\n\u201cWhat about you?\u201d I replied. \u201cIt\u2019s not about you. It\u2019s about your patient. It\u2019s about caring for your patient. That\u2019s what you signed up for.\u201d\nThis gave an opportunity for another speaker to chime in and take advantage of what he felt was oratory faux pas. \u201cI believe this is more than a job. It\u2019s a passion,\u201d with reverent emphasis on the word \u201cpassion.\u201d The crowed nodded in agreement, then turned and glared at me some more. I gave them one of those head tilting \u201cwhatever\u201d looks.\n\u201cListen, your passion should be your family, those around you that you love. You have to separate the two. There is not one of you that would not abandon your job for the sake of someone who you love and who needs you.\u201d You see, I know this from experience, from deep within my gut.\nTwo Septembers ago, I got a call from a hospital in New York. My son who was in college at the time was just diagnosed with leukemia. Fifteen minutes later, I jumped in a car and drove all night to New York, pretty much crying and pounding the steering wheel all along the way. I called one of my partners and said, \u201cI am not coming to work. I have no idea how long I\u2019ll be gone. If you need to hire someone to replace me, go right ahead.\u201d I slept in a chair next to his bed for 42 days. Do you think for one second I regretted not going to work? I\u2019d give up medicine and clean outhouses at Woodstock for all eternity if it meant I could help my child. People in medicine often say you can\u2019t separate the two. I say bullshit. You just don\u2019t know any better.\nListen, no matter how we like to hold up ourselves as the pillars of compassion, the keepers of the public well-being, we are just one profession out of countless others that keep our world moving. We are no more heroes than the social worker visiting homes in the projects, the farmer up at 4 to feed the cattle, the ironworker strapped to a beam on the 50th floor. We are no more a hero than the single mom working overnight as a custodian, trying to feed her kids. We are no more heroic than countless others who work in jobs they perhaps hate in order to care for and support the people they love.\nMaybe I\u2019m wrong in telling the group that medicine is just a job, but I am damn sure we in medicine are all wrong if we think our job is somehow more special and valuable than the bartender\u2019s.\nDr. Louis M.

I had been mulling around an article in my brain on palliative and end-of-life care. We were not too busy \u2013 in fact, we had no patients at the time \u2014 so I sat down and started tapping away in my two-finger, \u201cnever-took-typing\u201d style.\nTap tap\u2026tap tap tap\u2026tap\u2026tap tap.\nIn just a few hours, between sips of old coffee and bites of stale doughnuts, I had inadvertently penned one of the most-read essays ever on LinkedIn and perhaps one of the most-read articles of all time on end-of-life care: \u201cI Know You Love Me \u2014 Now Let Me Die.\u201d\nAnd when the comments started appearing under the post and the emails flooded my inbox, my heart broke because I came to understand that while my case for allowing you to be comfortable in letting you and your loved ones die in peace was well received, you also shed light on the sad reality that we as physicians were failing you.\nYou commented thousands of times on LinkedIn and various blogs.

It became clear that families literally were sitting around a table together and reading the essay as they decided to take their father or mother off life support. Still others in the final days and months of their lives were forcing the paper into the hands of their children in order to be allowed to die in peace. I had no idea you would pour your heart out to me and I could literally feel you trembling and sobbing as you hit the send key. I\u2019d see an email from someone I didn\u2019t know and my mouth would dry and my throat would thicken and I\u2019d feel a bit like I did when I found out my own child had leukemia. I noticed people staring at me at the Starbucks as tears poured down my face, wondering perhaps, what was going on in my life. I tried to shield my eyes with a venti.\nI did not plan to leave my mark on the world like this. I figured being a simple ER doc was enough. Is it possible to be thankful and proud, sad and heartbroken at the same time?\nCountless numbers of you, on LinkedIn and other blog sites, were weighing in about how the hospitals and doctors don\u2019t know shit or don\u2019t care or don\u2019t communicate or just want to milk you and the insurer for every buck you have. All jostling to get the most thumbs ups on how best to care for you or your mom or your dad. Substituting the wisdom of the doctor, for some nebulous friend who just a week earlier posted a recipe on how to make a breakfast danish bake out of pop-up rolls and a carton of brown sugar.\nWe live in a world of far too many chiefs and it is now way too easy to get other opinions that are flat out wrong.\n\u201cSo doctor, tell me please. Why can\u2019t you communicate better, be straightforward and honest? \u201c\nI warn you. You will find the answers to some of these questions disturbing.\nYou see, we are just too busy with electronic medical record data entry. This is the new norm. In the olden days, we spent our time in front of you. Pre-med students who shadow me fidget a bit. They want to see patients with me; instead, they get hourglasses and spinning cursors.\nWe are not at your side anymore, answering your questions, addressing your concerns. We have to move on, we have more clicks to do, more print functions to hit. We don\u2019t have time for you. You are our patients, but the computer is our master. You do what the master tells you.\nWe have a breakdown of our doctor patient relationship. We have moved away from our personal doctor to a hospitalist/hospital employee model. Your family doctor does not take care of you in the hospital anymore. Your health defaults to someone whose shift starts at 6 in the morning and ends at 6 at night. He or she is just not as vested in you. Also, the resident physician will be gone in a month and you will be turned over to someone else.\nWe fear malpractice. We\u2019d rather do too much than face the prospect of someone accusing us of doing too little. We don\u2019t want our names plastered all over some rating site or Angie\u2019s List. (It\u2019s good, though, if you need a plumber or carry out Chinese noodles.) You pay the price for this. I am human.\nYou are our patients, but the computer is our master. You do what the master tells you.\nWe are tired and we just don\u2019t want to deal with your arguing families and explain the same thing over five different iPhones; trying to assuage the guilt of children all over the country who may just see you on holidays and who, in many cases, may have an exaggerated understanding of your condition.\nWe also are afraid of you to some degree. The physician is not held in the same reverence as days gone past. Right or wrong, so much of our suggestions are questioned and scrutinized by you or your family. Not to say that you shouldn\u2019t but eventually you have to trust us. I know you will have your experiences telling me I\u2019m misguided. I may nod my head and act like I agree, then I\u2019ll move on.\nAs I said, you don\u2019t trust us like you used to. Sadly we are to blame. Our own communication skills are not the same as they once were. When my own son got cancer, I surrendered myself. \u201cYou tell us what to do. We are in your hands,\u201d I told his doctor. \u201cReally, what do I have to offer? My job is to cradle my child and stroke his hair while you plan his treatment? I know Emergency Medicine. I don\u2019t know chemo.\u201d\nSo much of our discussions have become defensive, so we just quit. We don\u2019t do well with conflict. We\u2019re the china cup generation of medicine.\nWe can\u2019t say no or we are not allowed to say no. Think about it. We ask code status, meaning how much aggressive end-of-life care you expect: \u201cDo you want to be on life support? Do you want to have CPR?\u201d\nI want to be able to say: \u201cYou do not meet code criteria, but I promise to keep you comfortable and to do everything I can do to ensure this, and allow you to see more sunsets with your mind intact.\u201d I need to be able to do this for you. I don\u2019t want to play god; I just want to do what is best and what is right. Please surrender yourself a bit. Let me take that burden off you and your family.\nI know you think your living will covers your bases, but there is a very real possibility that when you suddenly come to the ER in the final hours of your life, your family will panic and override your wishes. They are human too. They love you and are not ready to see you go.\nIn many cases, your living will most likely will not be readily available to us. Perhaps it is tucked away somewhere next to the file folder of old light bills and with that I\u2019ll pound away on your chest. You see, I don\u2019t know you. I don\u2019t know your wishes.\nI want you to ask me. \u201cWhat would you do? What would you hope for if this were you lying on this cot?\u201d Insist and even demand an honest answer, not choices of answers. \u201cDoctor\u2026again, what if this were you, what if this was your mom? I trust your experience.\u201d\nYou should hope for a doctor that knows love. Most of us do. We know the kind of love that transcends space and time. The kind of love that one feels when they hold their child as he suffers through chemotherapy. The kind of love that makes them cry when they think about fighting god for a chance to come down to earth and hold their 90-year-old child in the arms because they love them no less than when they were born. That is the kind of love most of your doctors hold in their hearts. I want you to know that about me. I want you to know that about us.\nWe want to do what is right. We want to comfort you. We want to be the voice of wisdom, of understanding and compassion. We want you to look back years from now and feel at peace. I don\u2019t want to have my mouth dry, my throat thicken or to have to shield my eyes at Starbucks because I opened your email and read that all to familiar in-box lament. The one that reflects a depth of agony, fear and regret that is infinite.\n\u201cI hope she can forgive me.\u201d\nDr. Louis M. Profeta is an emergency physician practicing in Indianapolis.

I stopped her.\n\u201cDid you ask him about the war?\u201d\nShe looked confused, as if trying to recall if this was somehow germane to the patient\u2019s chief complaint as to why he was in the emergency room at the time.\n\u201cHow old are you?\u201d I asked. \n\u201cTwenty-four,\u201d she replied. \n\u201cYou have maybe two years left before you will never be able to ask that question again. This is the greatest generation that ever lived. They died on battlefields all over the world and saved the millions from fascism. They all want to tell their stories before they die.  So let\u2019s check him out and then ask him about the war.\u201d \nAnd for the next 15 minutes, we sat in wonder and rapt attention as he told us with great pride that he had been a bomber pilot, fighting over Italy, the Balkans and later Berlin, where he was shot down.  He parachuted to safety and was taken prisoner, put in a Stalag POW camp, later liberated by Gen. George Patton, as he described him riding into camp on a tank, shiny helmet with a pistol strapped on his side. The student sat silent but glowed in wonderment at what she was experiencing. As we left the room, she turned to me. \n\u201cDr. Profeta, that was amazing. Thank you so much.\u201d \nI smiled in agreement.\n\u201cHe\u2019s fine, let him go home,\u201d and as I typed up his discharge paperwork, my fingers stopped for a bit and hovered above the keys as my mind flashed back to another time I asked that question. \n\u201cSo were you in the war?\u201d I asked the 90-year-old man who looked 75.\n\u201cOf course I was, we all were,\u201d he replied. His well-pressed daughter sat in the corner smiling with pride behind her bronze-rimmed glasses. \u201cI was with Patton in Europe in the Battle of the Bulge. I was a gunner in a half-track; we provided support for the tanks. I manned this fifty-caliber gun in the turret. You see the Nazi planes would start strafing us and, I\u2019d be there in my turret, BANG BANG BANG BANG! I had this foot operated \u2018gun thing\u2019 too you would step on and WHOOF WHOOF it would shoot these big shells out the side.\u201d \nI listened attentively as he talked about the fighting and how his brother was killed in Europe and how he wished it had been him since his brother had two small children. He held up his weathered hand to show me how tall the kids had been when he was killed. I hung on to the bed rail in silence. He told me about his nephews who were also killed, how his cousin was injured in the navy and how he had married the nurse that cared for him. He was animated in his demeanor, as he discussed every detail. The words flowed in a continuous stream of reflection like I have never heard. He held his head high and beamed with a mixture of pride and gratitude that some young punk like me would ask about his war service.  \nThen somehow the talk turned to the holocaust.\n\u201cDad, you helped liberate a camp didn\u2019t you?\u201d His daughter leaned forward in her chair. I thought I saw a faint quiver in his lip. \n\u201cYes, yes, we pulled into Austria and liberated Mauthhausen.\u201d His speech became fractured not like earlier, \u201cThere were these ovens and these burnt bodies\u2026I saw this guy in striped pants, there was this pit, and a bulldozer, it had a huge blade, and well they went all the way to the top and out the sides, and the ovens, and I saw\u2026and the\u2026they\u2026and they were all nude and you could not tell if they were women or men\u2026and\u2026and\u201d his faced turned sallow, and tears filled the wrinkles below his eyes and hovered for a second before falling. The words stuck thick in his mouth. His daughter sat staring at me in silent disbelief, and mouthed the words:\u201cI had no idea, I have never heard any of this before. He never, ever told me this.\u201d  \nI put my arm around him and held him tight. \u201cIt\u2019s OK, I\u2019m sorry I made you go there.\u201d\n\u201cNo, no,\u201d he patted my arm with a hand that once fired a fifty-caliber machine gun. \u201cI\u2019ll tell you this, though, I am not spending the night in this hospital. I feel great; I walk three blocks every day. Oh did I tell you about my cousin who got injured in the navy?

Soup would boil on the stove just in case she felt like a sip or two. Perhaps the radio softly played Al Jolson or Glenn Miller, flowers sat on the nightstand, and family quietly came and went. These were her last days. Spent with familiar sounds, in a familiar room, with familiar smells that gave her a final chance to summon memories that will help carry her away. She might have offered a hint of a smile or a soft squeeze of the hand but it was all right if she didn\u2019t. She lost her own words to tell us that it\u2019s OK to just let her die, but she trusted us to be her voice and we took that trust to heart.\nYou see, that\u2019s how she used to die. We saw our elderly different then.\nWe could still look at her face and deep into her eyes and see the shadows of a soft, clean, vibrantly innocent child playing on a porch somewhere in the Midwest during the 1920s perhaps. A small rag doll dances and flays as she clutches it in her hand. She laughs with her barefoot brother, who is clad in overalls, as he chases her around the yard with a grasshopper on his finger. She screams and giggles. Her father watches from the porch in a wooden rocker, laughing while mom gently scolds her brother. \nWe could see her taking a ride for the first time in an automobile, a small pickup with wooden panels driven by a young man with wavy curls. He smiles gently at her while she sits staring at the road ahead; a fleeting wisp of a smile gives her away. Her hands are folded in her lap, clutching a small beaded purse.\nWe could see her standing in a small church. She is dressed in white cotton, holding hands with the young man, and saying, \u201cI do.\u201d Her mom watches with tearful eyes. Her dad has since passed. Her new husband lifts her across the threshold, holding her tight. He promises to love and care for her forever. Her life is enriched and happy.\nWe could see her cradling her infant, cooking breakfast, hanging sheets, loving her family, sending her husband off to war, and her child to school.\nWe could see her welcoming her husband back from battle with a hug that lasts the rest of his life. She buries him on a Saturday under an elm, next to her father. She marries off her child and spends her later years volunteering at church functions before her mind starts to fade and the years take their toll and God says:\n\u201cIt\u2019s time to come home.\u201d\nThis is how we used to see her before we became blinded by the endless tones of monitors and whirrs of machines, buzzers, buttons and tubes that can add five years to a shell of a body that was entrusted to us and should have been allowed to pass quietly propped up in a corner room, under a window, scents of homemade soup in case she wanted a sip. \nYou see now we can breathe for her, eat for her and even pee for her. Once you have those three things covered she can, instead of being gently cradled under that corner window, be placed in a nursing home and penned in cage of bed rails and soft restraints meant to \"keep her safe.\"\nShe can be fed a steady diet of Ensure through a tube directly into her stomach and she can be kept alive until her limbs contract and her skin thins so much that a simple bump into that bed rail can literally open her up until her exposed tendons are staring into the eyes of an eager medical student looking for a chance to sew. She can be kept alive until her bladder is chronically infected, until antibiotic resistant diarrhea flows and pools in her diaper so much that it erodes her buttocks. The fat padding around her tailbone and hips are consumed and ulcers open up exposing the underlying bone, which now becomes ripe for infection.\nWe now are in a time of medicine where we will take that small child running through the yard, being chased by her brother with a grasshopper on his finger, and imprison her in a shell that does not come close to radiating the life of what she once had. We stopped seeing her, not intentionally perhaps, but we stopped.\nThis is not meant as a condemnation of the family of these patients or to question their love or motives, but it is meant be an indictment of a system that now herds these families down dead-end roads and prods them into believing that this is the new norm and that somehow the old ways were the wrong ways and this is how we show our love.\nA day does not go by where my partners don\u2019t look at each other and say, \u201cHow do we stop this madness? How do we get people to let their loved ones die?\u201d\nI\u2019ve been practicing emergency medicine for close to a quarter of a century now and I\u2019ve cared for countless thousands of elderly patients. I, like many of my colleagues, have come to realize that while we are developing more and more ways to extend life, we have also provided water and nutrients to a forest of unrealistic expectations that have real-time consequences for those frail bodies that have been entrusted to us.\nThis transition to doing more and more did not just happen on a specific day in some month of some year. Our end-of-life psyche has slowly devolved and shifted and a few generations have passed since the onset of the Industrial Revolution of medicine. Now we are trapped. We have accumulated so many options, drugs, stents, tubes, FDA-approved snake oils and procedures that there is no way we can throw a blanket over all our elderly and come to a consensus as to what constitutes inappropriate and excessive care. We cannot separate out those things meant to simply prolong life from those meant to prolong quality life. \nNearly 50 percent of the elderly US population now die in nursing homes or hospitals. When they do finally pass, they are often surrounded by teams of us doctors and nurses, medical students, respiratory therapists and countless other health care providers pounding on their chests, breaking their ribs, burrowing large IV lines into burned-out veins and plunging tubes into swollen and bleeding airways. We never say much as we frantically try to save the life we know we can\u2019t save or perhaps silently hope we don\u2019t save. When it\u2019s finally over and the last heart beat blips across the screen and we survey the clutter of bloody gloves, wrappers, masks and needles that now litter the room, you may catch a glimpse as we bow our heads in shame, fearful perhaps that someday we may have to stand in front of God as he looks down upon us and says, \u201cwhat in the hell were you thinking?\u201d \nWhen it comes time for us to be called home, those of us in the know will pray that when we gaze down upon our last breath we will be grateful that our own doctors and families chose to do what they should instead of what they could and with that we will close our eyes to familiar sounds in a familiar room, a fleeting smile and a final soft squeeze of a familiar hand.\nDr. Louis M.

You get assaulted in a mall parking lot and someone comes to your aid, helps ward off the attacker and calls the police? Or, you get assaulted in a mall parking lot and someone holds up a cell phone and records it all the while providing commentary like, \u201cDamn, she\u2019s getting her ass beaten; someone should call the police?\u201d\nJust the fact that you have to pause for an instant and contemplate the answer is proof enough.\nWe are becoming a nation of cell phone cowards, legions of do-nothing iPhone creepers who think that helping a fellow man or woman stops and ends with pressing \u201crecord.\u201d\nI\u2019ve been thinking about all of this more and more lately after seeing a recent news clip of two women fighting in our local Wal-Mart \u2014 the personal hygiene section, I might add \u2014 while a gaggle of Google-eyed, cell-phone cyclops looked on.  \nThe video went viral, predictably, resulting in news coverage across the country. \nWe should take comfort, though; not all is lost. It seems a six-year-old boy stepped in during the brawl and beat one lady over the head with a shampoo bottle to make it stop. You can\u2019t make this stuff up.\nIntervene, or record?\nThere used to be a time in America when we rushed to each other\u2019s aid. Now, we\u2019re more likely to rush to capture someone\u2019s distress for a chance at a snippet of YouTube fame. \nYes, there are exceptions. You surely could provide some real \u2013 or perhaps exaggerated, urban-myth \u2013 examples of person X dying while putting his own life at risk, or person Y getting sued trying to help break up an altercation. But, come on. You probably know someone who\u2019s held a phone out the side window of his car and recorded a crash scene or assault or whatever before giving a single bit of thought whether the police and fire had been called, if the occupant had been killed or if the family had even been notified. \nBut that\u2019s what Facebook and Twitter and Instagram are for, right?\nWe can now instantly post a photo or video of some tragedy and set into motion a chain of events leading to a Facebook instant message from a concerned \u201cfriend\u201d that says, \u201cI was on Facebook and I just saw a photo of a car just like yours. It\u2019s rolled over and smashed in a ditch and I just wanted to make sure you or your kids are OK.\u201d \nNow I do not want to suggest that Facebook is not the way to break this kind of tragic news, and most likely the \u201cfriend\u201d vis-\u00e0-vis Facebook is better suited at breaking this news to you than a police or hospital chaplain or the ER physician and a grief support team. After all, just last week they \u201cliked\u201d your recipe for red velvet cake, so now you have developed a lifelong bond.\nThis is the world we now live in. One where you can see a photo or a video of tragedy that befalls your family way before the hospital or the police notifies you. \nMy take: If it comes to a decision about whether or not you should intervene, it would be more acceptable and understandable if you just say, \u201cI can\u2019t, I couldn\u2019t, I\u2019m just not suited to get directly involved.\u201d That is okay.\nNot everyone has the physical gifts, aptitude, courage or even recklessness to jump in and try to stop whatever is happening. I get it. I\u2019m an ER doc. It took me years to be comfortable in a crisis. I also know that we can be so overwhelmed with emotions that we get lost as to what our role should be and how we should respond. It has happened to me many times. It even happens to those (police, fire, military, nurses, physicians, etc.) who have made it a lifetime career to help in a crisis. But I\u2019ll give you my other take on it. \nIf that cell phone in your hand is doing anything other than calling 911, then you are doing something wrong.\n\u2018Watch a bully get a taste of his own medicine\u2019\n\u2018VIDEO: Teacher beaten by student\u2019, \u2018two girls fight in the cafeteria\u2019, \u2018thug beats up homeless man\u2019, \u2018car crashes into a ravine\u2019, \u2018man jumps from a bridge\u2019, \u2018raging house fire\u2019.\nSure, you\u2019ve seen these headlines and the associated videos.\nMaybe you clicked upon them in some Facebook or Twitter feed. You might have paused the changer on a bit of trash journalism from a rerun of MSNBC\u2019s \u201cCaught on Camera.\u201d This is voyeuristic garbage that, if bundled up and sent to deep space, would make an alien gaze upon it and decide humans are a decent source of easily harvested protein able to be sucked up raw with a dollop of horseradish and a squeeze of lemon. We are becoming a generation of spineless mollusks. \nIt\u2019s sad, because even a slug will dive into a cabbage leaf.\nSome of you might take offense to me calling you or your kid a coward or refuting the argument that his or her recording of the locker room fight between the gym teacher and the student was meant to provide \u201cproof\u201d or \u201cto make sure those responsible were identified.\u201d Please; that never crossed your kid\u2019s mind. What did though, is this: \u201cDude, dude, this will look awesome on Twitter.\u201d\nHere is a bit for you to contemplate. I have yet to take care of a person who has been beaten to hell, whose first words were, \u201cGee, I hope someone recorded that.\u201d Every time you watch a video of someone suffering, either by an accident, an assault, or even some fault of their own, know that the person on the other end of the camera is most likely doing little to stop it, exhibiting a callous disregard for the physical or emotional well being of the individual or their family. In many instances they compound the humiliation by either posting it or doing nothing to stop it. \nWe have become cell phone cowards, a new generation of do-nothing iPhone peepers and creepers.\nOne day perhaps you could be on the receiving end of one of these tragedies and your grief and your distress can be paraded for the whole world to see. \nAnd get a million likes if you\u2019re lucky. \nDr. Louis M.

A good hug is one of the best feelings in the world. I love it when my kids hug me, friends, strangers, whomever. I love it when a patient gives me a hug on the way out. It doesn\u2019t happen very often, but when it does, it feels special.\nMy childhood is filled with hugs from my parents, relatives, teachers, friends, coaches, school bus drivers, school janitors, the lunch lady and on and on. But, now, hugging is not only under threat but in many venues it has been transformed by fear, by political correctness, by threat of litigation and by the actions of oversensitive, self-appointed \"protectors of our children\" into something else. It has been stripped of its transformative expression of love and cloaked in a robe of sexism or, even worse, perversion. It has become something to fear.\nIt only takes a click of a mouse to find countless schools, institutions and workplaces that have made the leap to banning hugging. From kindergartens to high schools, from places of employment to houses of worships, institutions are enacting rules that not only prohibit contact, but threaten \"the hugger\" with firing, expulsion or even possibility of criminal charges. Our bosses, our principals, our clergy, our parents and all of us individually bear part of the blame, because instead of taking a stand and saying \u201cyou got to be kidding me,\u201d we allow them and us to cave into fear of the \"what if\" and we follow along like feral kittens.\nThe need to be hugged and experience human contact is in the root of our DNA. It is the building block of our soul. It is as much a part of each of us as the air we breathe. We curl up and we die inside without it.\nI remember in college taking a psychology class where the professor showed videos of monkeys that, shortly after birth, were raised in isolation and deprived of any physical contact. They often were prone to violence and would sit in the corner hugging themselves and rocking in obvious despair. When placed back in cages later in life with other socialized monkeys, they cowered in fear. It was heartbreaking and even to this day, it is one of the most distressing films I have ever seen.\nOver the years in ER, there are many things that have distressed me, horrible things that wake me up at night. Images of parents hugging the dead body of a their child so tight you are certain a truck could not pull them apart. But the sick notion that hugging is anything other than a form of affection meant to comfort, thank, appreciate, love, or welcome another tops it all. The stupidity of our bosses, school administrators, educators, and oversensitive idiots who think there is something abusive or sexist in the act is beyond description. Oh sure, I know I\u2019ve seen the hyped-up news stories of some teacher or coach, or mother\u2019s ex-boyfriend, who took advantage a child and even robbed them of their innocence. Yes, it\u2019s horrible. Sure, there may be some perverse secondary gain some fringe sicko might find in the act. Certainly we must always work to prevent that. But you can\u2019t tell me that this fear should justify the creation of any policy that regulates an act of comfort and affection especially when that policy bans it all together.\nMy kids went to a fairly tough public school. The junior high football team allowed me to help coach mostly because I was a doctor, I brought lots of first-aid stuff and because I had a kid who was a really good player. There were only a couple kids that were, for lack of a better word, affluent. Many, both black and white came from families of single parents, at-risk kids, etc.\nI made a real concerted effort to never yell unless it was to cheer their effort and if the chance arose always putting my arms around them and telling them what a great job they did that day. I encouraged them to study, usually in my own subtle way.\nI\u2019d put an arm around them, pull them close and say something 'uplifting' like, \u201cHey, Laurell, were you an idiot in school today?\u201d\n\u201cNo doc, I wasn\u2019t an idiot today,\u201d he\u2019d smile with squinting eyes and a big-toothed grin.\n\u201cYou know, Laurell, the world is full of idiots. We don\u2019t need more idiots now do we?\n\u201cNo doc we don\u2019t,\u201d he\u2019d laugh, look at the ground and kick up some dirt.\nI kept up: \u201cWhat about tomorrow? Are you going to be an idiot tomorrow?\u201d\n\u201cNo, not tomorrow either,\" he\u2019d laugh again and shake his head inside his helmet.\n\u201cThen open a friggin book tonight, OK?\u201d\n\u201cOK.\u201d\n\u201cNow give me a hug,\u201d I\u2019d say.\nHe always obliged, awesome hugger, that Laurell. I pretty much did the same thing to all the kids to the point they would stop me, \u201cHey Devon, are you\u2026\u201d -- interrupting, \u201cNo, doc, I wasn\u2019t an idiot today.\u201d\nThen they\u2019d come up and give me a hug. A funny thing happened. In about two weeks, these tough kids, these children of felons, of divorce, of addicts, of poverty, started to come up to me without me saying a thing and give me a big old-fashioned bear hugs, sometimes picking me up off the ground.\nYou could see that not only did they want to express affection, they starved for it. I have three sons, one is still in high school, the others college. My star football player, who is the youngest, does not play anymore because of two knee injuries and I miss it. I still see his teammates, those kids from the past, at school functions or sometimes Steak n Shake, or roaming the sidelines of a basketball game or hanging in the parking lot after a football game. They all come up to me. None of them shake my hand. They saunter up next to me, put an arm on my shoulder until I recognize them and they turn and give me these huge welcoming hugs. It is the best.\nSo getting back to hugs. Not only should schools not ban them, they should encourage them. I propose that when the final bell rings, every one in class needs to stand up, turn to a neighbor and hug them. Or better yet, perhaps a random tone that sounds between periods that alerts students that they have to hurry up and hug someone. Imagine the incredible transformation that could happen if hugs became a habit: at school, at work, in our neighborhoods.\nImagine how the tension might be eased if rival gang members were, for a brief period, to contemplate hugging the guy across from them instead of shooting them. Imagine how the lonely kid might feel, the ugly kid, the tortured kid, the labile kid, the bullied kid, the fat kid, or simply the kid who might feel like an outcast, if some random student who he or she did not know, turned to them and did the unthinkable: gave them a hug.\nDr. Louis M.

I know the Gettysburg Address by heart. I can recite all the presidents. I can taste the difference between Diet Coke and Diet Pepsi, and I\u2019m fairly certain I can tell you the starting lineup from the 1976 Cincinnati Reds. But if you ask me if I\u2019m worried about Ebola, if our hospital is ready or if our nurses and staff are up to the challenge, chances are you will probably hear me say this:\n\u201cHell if I know.\u201d\nI have been practicing emergency medicine for more than 20 years and I\u2019ve seen close to 100,000 patients. I\u2019ve written a few books, published some papers, lectured a bunch of times, pissed off about 10,000 soccer moms when I wrote an article telling them their kids weren\u2019t playing the pros. I once even testified in front of a congressional sub-committee on hospital disaster preparedness. I\u2019m still beating myself for at least not stealing a pen, but it was part of my duty as the physician director of mass casualty preparedness for our emergency department.\nSo you would think if anyone in the emergency department trenches would be versed as to how this Ebola scare will unfold, if it will spread, what to expect, how to diagnose, screen, protect and treat, then I suppose it would be me.\nIf an investigator for Joint Commissions or some other oversight agency, a member of the press or a committee trying to ensure CDC compliance were to pull me aside to spot check my Ebola acumen, they\u2019d be satisfied with my answers and I\u2019d leave them feeling like they had done due diligence as an administrator.\n\u201cDr. Profeta, do we have enough protective stuff and does everyone know how to use it?\u201d\n\u201cYup.\u201d\n\u201cAre the screening plans in place?\u201d\n\u201cYeah, ya betcha.\u201d\n\u201cIs the staff versed in transmission and spread of Ebola?\u201d\n\u201cDarn tooten.\u201d\n\u201cHas everyone read all the CDC and hospital communiqu\u00e9s regarding Ebola?\u201d\n\u201cSure have.\u201d\n\u201cHave you practiced the drills in the ER in case we have someone show up with a possible exposure?\u201d\n\u201cMore times than Lois Lerner has hit her hard drive with a hammer.\u201d\nBut if they were to ask me if there are any other issues they should be aware of, I\u2019ll just stare with round blank eyes and keep my mouth shut until the right question is asked; the question they will pretend does not exist.\n\u201cDr. Profeta, will they \u2013 the staff, you, your partners \u2013 show up? \u201c\n\u201cThat, I don\u2019t know.\u201d\nSome years ago when I first started in practice, a very large hospital in our area was having trouble getting patients rapidly admitted from the ER to the floors. This resulted in a tremendous backlog of patients and extreme ER overcrowding. This naturally increased patient wait times and directly impacted the health of those coming to the ER. So, naturally, the hospital system formed a committee and hired consultants. They looked at every single variable: time to laboratory, time to X-ray, nursing changeover, bed request time and on and on and on. Do you know what they found? The roadblock in the movement of patients through this major medical system was housekeeping. Think about that. Housekeepers, traditionally the lowest paid and least-skilled division of employment of the hospital, were responsible for the movement and throughput of patients more than any other factor.\nIf the rooms on the floor were not cleaned fast enough, then no patients could move from the ER to the floor, and no patients from the waiting room to the ER. ER wait times rose and patient care suffered. Housekeepers handcuffed the entire system, and not because they were lazy. The regulations, protocols and procedures put into place to clean a room are so extensive that rapid room turnover was next to impossible with the current staffing model. That stuck with me. What is the rate-limiting step in a mass casualty scenario or massive patient influx that would handcuff us? Where will all the preparedness collapse? What is the leaking O-ring? What am I afraid will fail?\nAs I alluded to a bit earlier, I appeared before members of Congress who were investigating Midwest medical centers and regional hospital preparedness for a mass casualty event. The focus was on our readiness should a major earthquake hit the Midwest. The congressmen wanted to know if we had the capacity to mobilize our staff; they asked what assistance we needed. Toward the end of the discussion, they asked each of us what we were most afraid of. The responses were typical answers you would give to a member of Congress if you were seeking money (not having enough resources, not enough congressional or governmental support, not having enough staff or equipment or infrastructure, etc.)\nWhen they got to me, asking what I worried about, I simply said: \u201cThe flu.\u201d\nNow, flash forward. I wonder if what I really meant to say was \u201cEbola.\u201d\nWhen it comes to our ER and our ability to provide the best care during the worst extremes, I have no doubt we can mobilize our hospital to care for hundreds and hundreds of seriously injured patients. We have modeled our Emergency Department response to a mass-casualty incident in much the way Israeli hospitals have structured their programs. (As a side note, Israel is light years ahead of us in terms of all mass casualty \u2013 chemical, biological, environmental, mad-made \u2013 preparedness.) Specifically, we model our plan after Western Galilee hospital on the border of Israel and Lebanon. This is a large, major, modern-day medical center under constant threat from Hezbollah rockets from Lebanon. They train and drill with a level of involvement, passion and commitment that exceeds anything we can muster.\nThe staff at my hospital in Indianapolis, however, has bought into it and I truly believe that there is no ER in Indiana, and few in the Midwest, that have a better plan in place. We also gained a better understanding of the type of injuries we would see in each scenario. More specifically, we wanted to know from a pure number standpoint how many patients would have to go to the operating room the minute they hit the door, how many would need to be on ventilators and how many would need emergent life-saving intervention. Fortunately, and not so fortunately, the proliferation of research in this area has provided plenty of hard data well documented in the literature. Ultimately, all things being equal, the data seems to indicate a suicide type bomb loaded with ball bearings or other projectiles placed in a crowded area will result in the largest number of patients requiring immediate, emergent and life-saving intervention. While a disaster like a major earthquake will result in far more fatalities, far less people will require absolute immediate operative or life-saving intervention. All we really need to know is, what type of event, how many patients, and it\u2019s pretty easy to calculate what to expect from an acuity standpoint. In the ER, it isn\u2019t the total number of patients that concerns us, it\u2019s the number we get that will die if not treated in minutes or a few hours. The rest we have no problem letting wait.\nUltimately, though, what I am getting at is that the trauma from a major incident like an earthquake or terrorist attack is very predictable. All you really need to know is the type of event and the numbers and you almost immediately have a pretty good idea of what to expect.\nBut a real bad flu?\nThere is no way you can prepare for it. The goal should be to protect your hospital from it.\nWe have seen influenza pandemics before, the most notable being the Spanish flu of 1918. Researchers estimate between 20 and 100 million peopled died from this strain of flu. What was even more concerning was the number of deaths that occurred in previously healthy people. Each year in the United States, about 30,000-40,000 deaths and 200,0000 hospitalizations can be attributed in part to influenza. Most deaths are in the elderly with pre-existing serious health problems. The Spanish flu of 1918 was different. It killed the healthy, able bodied. It unleashed an incredible degree of viral savagery with an infection rate of nearly 50 percent. It was a biological holocaust.\nDoctors and nurses treat flu patients lying on cots and in outdoor tents at a hospital camp during the influenza epidemic of 1918. (Photo: Hulton Archive/Getty Images)\nThus my biggest fear has always been a strain of flu that is highly contagious with a high mortality rate. The Spanish-flu mortality rate of 1918 was 2 to 5 percent. Ebola has a 20 to 90 percent mortality rate, but it fortunately is not quite as contagious as Influenza. However, I still keep going back to flu and envisioning an epidemic of the Spanish type that will quickly fill all our inpatient beds, every ICU bed, every ventilator, every outpatient bed, every cot, gurney and chair in the ER and in all the waiting rooms. I\u2019m afraid that a flu virus this aggressive will bring five dying flu victims to our ER each day and dozens more with a real possibility of dying.\nThis would occur on top of a department that is always operating at capacity and drowning in documentation and electronic medical record bureaucracy. After 30 days in our ER, nearly 150 people will have died, providers will be physically and mentally spent and morale will be at below-despair levels. Multiply it by 20 or so other hospitals in the area and now we are talking about 3,000 members of our community dead in only a single month. The obituary pages of the local paper will be thicker than the advertising section the day after Thanksgiving. Expand that number statewide and nationwide and the numbers become so immense they aren\u2019t even real.\nNow imagine a realistic scenario in which the flu vaccine only provides immunity to 50 percent of the recipients. That means that half of our ER staff who are seeing all these patients will have little protection, outside of gowns, masks, and gloves, against a virus that is spread primarily though coughing, sneezing and saliva. Simply put, some of us in the trenches in damn near every ER in America will almost certainly die. It could be me, it could be any one of my partners, colleagues and co-workers and it could be one of our children or a spouse who gets infected when one of us comes home thinking the headache and fatigue they are feeling is simply exhaustion from the workload of the day. Can you picture it?\nNow imagine that huge numbers of hospital staff \u2013 from doctors to housekeepers, from food services to registration, from security and parking to transportation will decide not show up. They will call in sick or simply just say: \u201cNo, I\u2019m not coming to work today.\u201d In just a few days, human waste, debris, soiled linens, the sick, the dying and the bodies will pile up. We will be overwhelmed and unable to offer much in the way of assistance because the labor-intensive protocols that allow us to safely care for even one patient are just too exhausting. These procedures are barely repeatable more than once or twice of day, and fraught with so many steps and potential for mistake that it becomes too physically and emotionally taxing for the staff to do \u2026 so they simply wont show up.\nAnd I am not sure I will, either.\nI love emergency medicine. I love helping people and saving lives and I think I\u2019m pretty good at it, but I am also a person and I have a wife and three children that I love and want to see grow up. I also am keenly aware that not a damn thing I do will have any real impact on the survivability of a patient with either the Spanish flu or Ebola. Fluids, rest and prayer is about all there is to offer. There is an old adage that says a hospital is no place for a sick person. I think whoever first said that had Spanish flu and Ebola in mind.\nSo we drill and we prepare and we post placards and do screening but no one is asking why in the hell are they coming to us in the first place? Fluids and rest can be provided anywhere: an empty warehouse or a huge tent in the middle of farmland. Why would we not just take the care to them in the form of special traveling Ebola-mobiles that triage and treat the patients at home? Why can we deliver the mail, pickup the garbage and recyclables at damn near every house in America, but we can\u2019t pull up a retrofitted UPS van, drop off a mid-level provider in a hazmat gown, let them do an assessment, draw some blood, drop off cans of rehydrating formula to their doors, clean linen, biohazard bags, gowns and gloves for family members, slap a warning sticker on the front door, tell them you will stop by tomorrow and move on to some other location? I know I sound crass, perhaps like I don\u2019t really have sympathy for these very ill patients. This could not be further from the truth. I\u2019m just kind of angry. I know there is a better way than risking the infrastructure of a medical center for the sake of a few patients that will either do OK at home with simple supportive care or die no matter what care I provide. We\u2019ve had years to prepare for this, we\u2019ve hung all our hopes on a vaccine and not nearly enough thought on containment should a vaccine fail.\nToday\u2019s Ebola is tomorrow\u2019s Spanish flu. We\u2019ve had nearly a hundred years to get ready and the best we can come up with is plastic suits, double gloves, respirators, and masks. The battleground of this problem can\u2019t be in the hospital. It is unwinnable in our emergency rooms.\nI think I might just call in sick.\nDr. Louis M.

However, in 2017 I believe we\u2019ll see not only the fourth African American to join, but we\u2019ll all witness the first billionaire Bad Boy.\nSean \u201cDiddy\u201d Combs is unquestionably a consummate entrepreneur. I predict his portfolio of Bad Boy Records, Revolt TV, Wine & Spirits, Sean John, AQUAhydrate, and more, currently valued at $750 Million, will see an overall increase in valuation strong enough to push him over the billion dollar mark. However, Diddy becoming a billionaire should not be taken lightly. It\u2019s significance carries major impact, especially in 3 categories:\nHe\u2019ll Be An Economic Pioneer\nCombs will become only the 4th African American to ever make the exclusive billionaire club, instantly making him a black economic pioneer. \u201cThey\u2019ll be what they see\u201d is a powerful mantra of the 100 Black Men organization and for many of the world\u2019s black people, Mr. Combs' triumph becomes another beacon of hope towards our financial empowerment. Despite making great strides over the last several decades, we still lag behind in every economic category, including broad disparities in unemployment and poverty rates. Namely because of Sean Combs' global and multigenerational influence, he is poised to become an inspirational symbol of economic power.\nHe\u2019ll Legitimize The Economic Power Of Hip-Hop\nDiddy becoming a billionaire also helps to legitimize the economic power of hip-hop, still considered a new (and for some) a weakening genre of music. Among all genres of music, hip-hop, founded in just 1973, is still relatively young compared to other popular categories such as rock, pop, and soul. Yet, out of all genres of music, only rock has created a billionaire, with Sir Paul McCartney. The only other musically associated billionaire is theatrical composer, Andrew Lloyd Webber. Sean Combs becoming a billionaire will make him only the 3rd musical artist in history to do so. Not bad coming from a newbie music genre. Further supporting hip-hop\u2019s overall economic power, behind Combs is a long list of rappers and rap producers with substantial wealth. I predict hip-hop artist Jay Z and hip-hop super producer Dr. Dre, with a net worth of $610 million and $700 million respectively, to join the billionaire club in the near future. \nHe\u2019ll Break The Rules Of Massive Wealth Creation\nLastly, Diddy\u2019s diverse portfolio of assets suggests the path to billionaire status doesn\u2019t require the traditional strategy of having only one major source of investment. Of the 1,810 world billionaires, Forbes lists more than 98% deriving the majority of their wealth from a single source (think Bill Gates with Microsoft, Reid Hoffman with LinkedIn, Jeff Bezos with Amazon, etc). Sean Combs is the exception to the traditional billionaire \u201cwealth source\u201d rule. His diversified portfolio of music, spirits, clothing, media, & startup investments equally contribute to his wealth. Sean \u201cDiddy\u201d Combs proves that Bad Boys who break the rules don\u2019t have to finish last. \nThis article is part of the LinkedIn Top Voices list, a collection of the must-read writers of the year.

While my stance on the importance of companionship and marriage remain unchanged, it\u2019s become clear that \u201cdating\u201d as we traditionally understand it, has forever changed.\nAll trends suggest a significant decrease in dating around the world. This, compounded by research that suggests the average single doesn\u2019t go on one date in a year, will result in what I believe to be the most significant drop in the percentage of people who date ever seen in modern history. I believe 80% of singles will not go on one date in 2017. There are five factors driving the global dating decline:\n1) Dating App Analysis Paralysis\nThere are literally thousands of mobile dating apps and websites, so many that for any niche or abstract interest you can think of, there is most likely a dating site for it. With virtually millions of singles ready to connect, you would think dating should increase. The issue, however, is in that perceived pool of daters, the fact that users of these sites and apps believe there is an endless number of options creates a dangerous psychological effect best described in psychologist's Barry Schwartz\u2019s book Paradox of Choice. Schwartz argues that more is actually less and when presented with more options, we derive less satisfaction and happiness. Moreover, such abundant options often cause an analysis paralysis where we over-analyze or over-think a situation so that a decision or action is never taken. This is precisely what\u2019s happening with dating apps and sites today. Users have what they believe are so many options that they rarely connect with the options they do have (and when they do connect, have little satisfaction with their choices).\n2) Cheapening of Sex\nNever in our lifetime has sex been so easy to come by and at the same time valued so little. At the touch of a mobile phone, you can order anything from pornography to a prostitute. If the cost of the former is too high, one of the thousands of \u201chook-up\u201d apps can deliver you effortless free sex within moments. Just 15 years ago, sex was often the result of effort put forth through courting and committed dating. Today, sex is often expected before dating even begins. As so many people have told me \u201cwhy date when I can remain single and get sex whenever I want it.\u201d  \n3) Drop in Value of Marriage\nThe most alarming statistic foreshadowing the decline of dating comes from a 2014 Pew Research survey that found 67% of millennials no longer see value in getting married. This is an incredibly sobering figure for marriage advocates. Once someone no longer believes they should put effort towards marriage, the prerequisite action of dating becomes no longer necessary. \n4) No One Knows What \u201cDating\u201d Means Anymore\nAsk 10 people to define what dating means and you\u2019ll get 10 different answers. I asked this question recently to my social media community and received a wide range of responses from \u201cjust hanging out\u201d to \u201cit\u2019s like a job interview\u201d to \u201cit means going somewhere exciting.\u201d The fact that there are so many disparate opinions of the word \u201cdating\u201d suggests it no longer has real meaning. For the record, my definition of dating: is an activity two people participate in to either determine if there is serious romantic interest or to further already established serious romantic interest.   \n5) Lack of Belief\nThrough my interactions with singles as clients, at events, and through social media communication, I\u2019ve witnessed a significant shift in belief over the years. When I originally began my career in the love industry 8 years ago, the questions I heard mostly focused on \u201cwhere\u201d or \u201chow\u201d to find a husband or wife. However, over recent years, the overwhelming most popular question from both women and men focuses on \u201cif\" there are any good men or women left. This may seem subtle, but significance can be found in the mindset behind the question. Our belief becomes our reality. If you\u2019re single and doubt a romantic partner exists, you don\u2019t have any motivation to pursue love, let alone go on a date.  \nThis article is part of the LinkedIn Top Voices list, a collection of the must-read writers of the year.

Here\u2019s How I Found Mine.", "body": "There has been no greater impact on my professional, personal, and romantic life than having mentors. That\u2019s right, I have someone\u2019s guidance in every aspect of my life so, yes, I even have a love mentor! The benefit of mentorship hasn\u2019t only been through my role as mentee, I\u2019ve also realized the power of being a mentor, starting in college with the Big Brothers Big Sisters program and continuing through today where I still mentor several people.\nWhile mentorship has a certain meaning to many, it\u2019s not neatly defined, causing confusion about exactly \u201cwhat is a mentoring relationship?\u201d The largest misconception I\u2019ve noticed is the thought you can\u2019t be mentored unless you have an official relationship with someone who confirms they\u2019re your mentor. This is an old and limiting belief. I spent the early part of my business career being mentored by Steve Jobs, Bill Gates, Susan Taylor, & Reginald Lewis. None of them knew it, though. I believe simply listening to someone\u2019s speeches, reading articles and blog posts they\u2019ve written, or exchanging thoughts with them via social media, can all be considered \u201cbeing mentored.\u201d At the end of the day, I define mentorship as a personal development in which a more experienced or more knowledgeable person guides a less experienced or less knowledgeable person.\nThat being said, you won\u2019t get an argument from me about whether formal mentorship is more effective. It\u2019s MUCH more effective! A relationship with established roles and defined expectations always gets optimal results. So how do you structure a formal mentoring relationship, especially with someone who is highly sought after? Well, the first thing to know is while it may seem against conventional thought, whatever you do, please, please, please do not ask someone to be your mentor. Seems strange, right? You would think in order for someone to be a mentor, you would need to ask them.\nThe problem is when we ask we\u2019re typically asking strangers, people we have only met recently, or those we don\u2019t yet have strong bonds with. Sheryl Sandberg, COO of Facebook, sums it up best in her book Lean In:\n\u201cIf someone has to ask the question, the answer is probably no. When someone finds the right mentor, it is obvious.  The question becomes a statement. Chasing or forcing that connection rarely works.\u201d\n So the real question is not so much \u201chow to ask someone to be a mentor\u201d but rather, \u201chow to build a rapport with someone you would like to become your mentor?\u201d Here are the 5 steps I used (as well as steps that were used on me) to seal the deal on my most rewarding mentoring relationships.\n  1. Become Mentee Material\nAre you somebody you yourself would like to mentor? Are you open, flexible, resilient, and respectful? Are you eager to learn, and committed to modifying how you\u2019re interacting in the world so you can have even more success, reward and happiness?\nIf the answer is \u201cno\u201d don\u2019t move to step 2 until you nail this one first. It took several failed mentoring relationships for me to appreciate the importance of becoming mentee material. Be someone who is already actively building his/her life, and is demonstrating that every day.\n  2. Make Sure The Person Shares Your Values\nDon\u2019t simply see their awards and accolades and because you aspire for those same things believe he or she is the right person to guide you. It\u2019s critical that you know your potential mentor has the same values you do. Values are essentially your guidebook to life. If your mentor has different values, it means they play by a different set of rules from you. Some of which you may consider immoral or unethical.\nMost people searching for a mentor don\u2019t focus on values because they either don\u2019t know their own (and so don\u2019t have anything to match against) or don\u2019t want to expend the effort to assess someone else\u2019s values. Determining someone\u2019s values requires dedication. You have to watch actions play out over time. While values are key, I don\u2019t believe any other similarities are critical \u2013 so your mentor doesn\u2019t need to be the same ethnicity, religion, gender, or nationality. My greatest mentors (like Ed Neff pictured above) have all been different from me in many aspects, but we always had the same values in common. Shared values are the single most important matchmaking category for success (and that\u2019s in all relationships \u2013 business, platonic, and romantic). \n  3. Advocate For Their Work!\nTweet their posts, comment in a positive way on their blogs, share their updates, start a discussion on LinkedIn about a post they\u2019ve made, promote and attend a live talk they\u2019re giving, and the list goes on.  In short, offer your unique voice, perspectives, experiences and resources to further the action and conversation that these influencers have sparked.  Understand that you are able to be of service to them, and go out and do it. In particular, show up in their comments \u2013 this is where many people with large followings go to for their \u201coxygen.\u201d Continue to show up, give insight, and provide value, consistently. It\u2019s important to note this step isn\u2019t simply about advocating their work for a few weeks and thinking you\u2019ll be noticed immediately. It takes time and keep in mind, you may never be recognized for being their advocate. It took me 4 years of consistently promoting and attending his independent film events before finally connecting with someone who later became my mentor, Ed Neff. What got me through those many years of advocating with no reciprocation was shifting my mindset to giving with no expectation. \n  4. Elevate Your Value To Them Over Time\nGo beyond the comments and offer ideas, refer new clients or business to them. What finally placed me in a position of strength with Ed was when I introduced him to a potential acquirer of one of his businesses. This increased value will move you from someone your possible mentor sees as merely a member of their audience to a member of their network. It\u2019s this critical step I see so many not do and it\u2019s the one strategic move that will most differentiate you from mentee potential to mentee personified. \n  5. Don\u2019t Ask For Mentorship, Make A Statement\nGoing back to the Sanberg quote above, you\u2019ll know your relationship is in the right place for formal mentorship when you don\u2019t have to \u201cask\u201d but simply say \u2013 \u201cyou\u2019re my mentor.\u201d I recall when I made this same statement to Ed, we were having dinner and towards the end I simply said \u201cthanks for being such a great mentor.\u201d That was 7 years of stellar guidance ago.\nFinding a great (formal) mentor can seem daunting, but start where you are. Begin through the inspiring people you\u2019re already interacting and working with now. Mentors need to be people to whom you have demonstrated your potential \u2013 who know how you think, act, communicate and contribute. And they have to like, trust and believe in you already (why else would they help you?).  They also need to believe with absolute certainty that you\u2019ll put to great use all their input and feedback."}, {"author": "Paul Carrick Brunson", "headline": "It\u2019s Called \u201cNetworking\u201d Not \u201cUsing\u201d", "body": "I worked for Oprah Winfrey and as a result, I've become popular for a particular favor.

Can you introduce me to Oprah so I can pitch it to her for funding or to partner with me?\u201d\nI wonder do they really expect my reply to be:\n\u201cSure, let me fire-off an email immediately to her and make an introduction.\u201d\nLet\u2019s get serious folks!\nThe biggest problem people have with networking is going in for the \u201cask\u201d too soon.

Here's What I Learned From Them.", "body": "I have spent decades \u201cbeing educated\u201d \u2013  in college, graduate school, numerous professional certifications, and now a PhD program. All of that schooling and training helped shape the person I am today, but at no point in my life  has there been a more profound education than my time working for Enver Yucel and Oprah Winfrey.\nEnver and Oprah are two extraordinary people. And on top of that, they\u2019re both billionaires. On the surface, they appear to be totally different people. They are in different industries, have different family structures, practice different religions, and speak different languages. However, once you get past their written biographies and dig deeper, you will notice they possess many of the same successful habits.\nI had the opportunity to work with both Oprah and Enver for 6 years collectively and those were, hands down, the best professional experiences of my life. I worked my ass off for them and in doing so absorbed everything I could.\nIt\u2019s my honor to share with you what I learned from them. Here is Part 1 of the 20 successful habits I learned working for two billionaires:\n  1) Invest in Yourself\nThis is a very simple concept, but something you would think someone who has \u201cmade it\u201d would stop doing. Not at all for these two. I saw them both spend a significant amount of time dedicating their resources to self-development  (whether it be a new language, exercise, social media classes, etc). The moment you stop investing in yourself is the moment you have written off future dividends in life.\n  2) Be Curious\u2026About Everything\nWhat the average person sees as mundane or overly complicated is not viewed the same way with a billionaire mindset. I once had a 30 minute conversation with Enver about the height of the curbs in Washington DC versus Istanbul, Turkey.  Billionaires are incredibly curious; what the rest of the world thinks is a problem and complains about \u2014 that\u2019s what these people go and work on.\n  3) Surround Yourself With \u201cBetter\u201d People\nI hope this is why they kept me around :-). Seriously, I never knew my bosses to keep anyone less-than-stellar in their inner circle. There were many times I thought to myself, \u201cDamn, they have dream-teams built around them.\u201d Jim Rohn had it right, \u201cYou are the average of the 5 people you spend the most time with.\u201d\n  4) Never Eat Alone\nThe last time I had dinner with Enver, as well as the last time I ate dinner with Oprah, there were easily 15 people at our tables, respectively. Coincidence? While most of us derive our key information from blogs or the newspaper, power players get their information from the source (other power players), directly. However, just because you can\u2019t call up the Obamas and break bread with them doesn\u2019t mean eating with others in your circle doesn\u2019t carry value. In one of my favorite reads of the last few years called Never Eat Alone author Keith Ferrazzi breaks down how you can identify \u201cinformation brokers\u201d to dine with you.  I\u2019ve seen first hand how enormous the benefits are of this strategy.\n  5) Take Responsibility For Your Losses\nI was working for Oprah during the time she was taking heat from the media about poor network ratings. I was also working for Enver during the closing of one of his prized divisions. What I witnessed them both do in response was powerful. Opposed to covering the losses up with fancy PR tactics, both stepped to the stage and said in essence \u201cI own it and I\u2019m going to fix it\u201d and dropped the mic. Guess what?  They sure did fix things (It\u2019s widely noted Oprah\u2019s network is realizing ratings gold and Enver\u2019s assets have probably doubled since the division closing).\n  6) Understand The Power Of \u201cLeverage\u201d\nThis is something that was quite a shock to me. From afar, a billionaire appears to be someone who is a master at everything. But, in truth, they\u2019re specialists in one or a few areas and average or subpar at everything else. So, how do they get so much done? Leverage! They do what they do best and get others to do the rest . Here\u2019s a great article on leverage. Keep in mind I see this done with wealthy people and their money all of the time \u2013 they use OPM (other people\u2019s money) for most or all of their projects.\n  7) Take No Days Off (Completely)\nI recall going on vacation with Enver several times, yachting up and down the southwestern coast of Turkey (also known as the blue voyage). Sounds ballerific, right? No doubt we had a great time, but mixed in with all that swimming and backgammon was discussion of business, discussion of strategy, planning and plotting. The best way I can describe this habit is thinking about your business or your idea like your literal baby. No matter your distance, you don\u2019t stop thinking of him/her (and after just having a second son, I can attest to this).\n  8) Focus On Experiences vs. Material Possessions\nWhen you have money, your toys are big. However, the vast majority of money I saw spent on their \u201cleisure\u201d was on actual experiences versus the typical car, jewelry, and clothes we\u2019re familiar with seeing in music videos and gossip blogs. I recall one time at dinner with Oprah, I spotted a table of about 20 girls off to the side. I later found out Ms. Winfrey was treating some of her graduating girls from her school in South Africa to dinner in NYC. Experiences create memories, and memories are priceless.\n  9) Take Enormous Risks\nThis is another one of those successful habits every entrepreneur can attest to. A matter of fact, Entreprenuer.com created a great infographic outlining commonalities of the world\u2019s billionaires and one of the most prominent was this characteristic: billionaires are not adverse to risk. What intrigues me even more about Enver and Oprah was that even at their high financial status and success level, they still possessed a willingness to risk their most precious asset (their name and legacy) on new and bolder projects. If you\u2019re not taking risks, you\u2019re not making moves!\n  10) Don\u2019t Go At It Alone\nNothing great in life is achieved alone. Especially in business, success isn\u2019t a solo act. This character trait is akin to \u201csurrounding yourself with better people.\u201d It takes teamwork to make the dream work.\n  What I witnessed from working for Enver and Oprah were characteristics and successful habits that not only apply to business \u201cwins,\u201d but also translate to general life success. I sincerely hope the tips I\u2019ve shared here will inspire you to create (or maintain) great habits for your success.

Seriously, that\u2019s it. I have the privilege of sitting down one-on-one mostly with people I\u2019ve admired from afar \u2013 business leaders, artists, and change agents. But in a selfish move, to guard my memory of their work, I literally pray nothing will happen that will ruin my appreciation of them or their work.\n  So, when I sat down yesterday with legendary director Spike Lee for a one-on-one interview, I had the same hope. My memory of Spike goes back to his first feature length film \u2018She\u2019s Gotta Have It\u2019 and the one thing I\u2019ve never seen him do over the years is stand down from an issue. With a personality like his, an interview can become complicated because it takes cooperation to make for a good question and answer session. There needs to be willingness from both the interviewer and the interviewee to give and take. A good interview is like watching a couple flawlessly tango.\n  With my single hope, I was focused on doing everything within my control to make my interview with Spike Lee good. As I awaited for him on the set, alongside a group of about a dozen people, I began to think about all the things I had learned over the years in order to direct the interview along the questions and themes I had researched about him. Someone then entered the room and said \u201cSpike just arrived downstairs, he\u2019ll be up in 3 minutes!\u201d As the 3-minute countdown began in my head, I wasn\u2019t nervous, I was in the zone. An edge of super confidence even came over me. I began to think, forget about this simply being good, I would show Spike Lee what a GREAT interview really was. Well, I was ROYALLY mistaken! Little did I know, in 3 minutes, I would get a master class from Spike Lee.\n  Now, less than a full day after the interview, I remain in awe of what I witnessed Spike do, effortlessly. The techniques he used should be studied and considered if you are seeking to quickly place yourself in a position of power in a room of strangers or in an interview.\n  Here are the 10 things I learned from the legendary director Spike Lee on how to control a room (and an interview).\n  1. Have a Powerful Preceding Reputation\nThis is much easier said than done, but it made an impact in the room so I have to mention it. Everyone knows who Spike Lee is and most would agree his brand conjures up thoughts of: intelligence, creativeness, and defiance against the status quo. These descriptors were already on our minds before he entered the room and so, it played a part in his perception once we saw him. Remember that your reputation always precedes you. Control your brand, before you even think about controlling the room.\n  2. Walk in the Room Boldly\nThe moment Spike entered the room, he didn\u2019t stop walking until he landed at his interview chair. He moved with a sense of urgency. I\u2019ve watched countless other power players do the same. Not hesitating when you break the room\u2019s threshold gives the appearance of a true sense of purpose. When you enter a room, go to where you want to be and don\u2019t let anything or anyone interfere with you. Spike sure didn\u2019t.\n  3. Make Eye Contact With Everyone\nAs Spike walked to his chair, he appeared to be surveying the room. I didn\u2019t quite understand it until I saw him sit down. He was actually making eye contact with everyone, individually. There were only about a dozen of us in the room and Spike connected with each person. Most people in the room simply got a quick glance and slight smile, and while appearing minor, these two actions were significant. One of the most important nonverbal signals people use to size you up and figure out your intent is your facial expression. A slight smile and eye contact suggests you\u2019re approachable, but not overly eager.\n  4. Make it Clear You\u2019re On a Tight Timetable\nWhen Spike finished his room survey and sat down, he blurted out in a fun yet serious tone \u201cOkay my people, let\u2019s go, I have to be at \u2018The Daily Show\u2019 soon.\u201d In just a few words, he put everyone on notice that we had a strict deadline. Psychologically, creating a sense of urgency is a master move of a power player. Urgency causes people to act quickly because you stop thinking about the unnecessary and only concentrate on the critical. So all those extra camera shots and scenes we wanted to get with Spike got thrown out the window, he gave us a new mission, just focus on the main interview. It was at this exact moment that I believe Spike \u201ctook control\u201d of the room. He emerged as our leader (after only being in the room for a few minutes and uttering only a handful of words).\n  5. Reference Other Important Projects You\u2019re Involved With\nIf you notice in the prior point, Spike mentioned \u201cThe Daily Show.\u201d Was this by accident? Perhaps, but perhaps not. Strategically dropping a name is much different from bragging, with the latter being about your ego and the former being about the ego of those in the room with you. It\u2019s critical to talk yourself up. Who else is going to do it? Especially when you\u2019re working on important projects. It\u2019s how you manage your brand and in cases like \u201ccontrolling a room,\u201d it works wonders. There we were, the Our World Black Enterprise staff (an amazing TV team that puts on a quality show but we have no where near the budget, audience, or brand of The Daily Show\u2026at least, not yet :-)). So when Spike dropped such a high level brand, he added a sense of competitiveness to our urgency. This again was a great move. To be honest, it made me feel like I had to step up my game. I also felt humbled. Knowing my team and I were in the same media lineup of The Daily Show.\n  6. Be The First To Break The Ice\nWith Spike seated, it was my turn to take my place in the seat across from him. Once within eyesight, I gave him a smile, held out my hand and said \u201cIt\u2019s an honor to meet you Mr. Lee.\u201d I like to build a rapport with my interviewees before the start of the interview, so I was ready to launch into a pre-scripted ice breaker. I had prepared in my mind to ask Spike about the children\u2019s book he and his wife wrote. Especially, since my family owns a copy of the book and I had recently read it to my little boys. But before I could get out my words, with laser quickness, Spike asked me \u201cso, where did you go to school?\u201d I responded, \u201cOld Dominion for undergrad & Georgetown for grad.\u201d He then immediately asked, which team I preferred. I answered \u201cGeorgetown.\u201d As I finished pronouncing the \u201ctown\u201d in Georgetown, he started with his next question about my thoughts on the basketball coach. Long story short, this dude completely flipped the script on me!!! He was leading our pre-interview session. Guiding it where he wanted, at his own pace. Spike broke the ice first. \u201cBreaking the ice\u201d is basically the initial dialogue you have with someone, just the first 1 or 2 exchanges. From what I\u2019ve witnessed, whoever controls those first few exchanges, typically maintains control of the conversation going forward. In this case, Spike beat me to it. So after meeting him just seconds prior, before the camera even began to roll, the legendary director was already controlling the interview.\n  7. Use \u201cPower\u201d Body Language Moves\nOnce the official on air interview began (Spike yelled \u201cAction\u201d, by the way), I noticed something Spike was doing that I first mistook for coyness and later realized it was another masterful control move. We were both seated in swivel chairs and with the ease of a foot push, the chair would swivel from side to side. While I asked him questions, he sat in a squared off position with me \u2013 belly to belly. However, once my question was asked and we began to exchange on the topic, his foot would swivel his chair ever slightly away from me. From being someone who has studied body language for nearly a decade, I\u2019m aware that the movement of someone\u2019s belly button away from you suggests a disinterest but masterful Spike completely remixed this rule. He would focus on me, then move away, then focus on me again, then move away. It was very effective in making me feel as if at certain points I was losing his attention and therefore had to change the flow or subject in order to gain his attention back. He was making me work and controlling the topics of our conversation, by the slight push of his foot.\n  Another body language rule he used quite effectively was pointing his finger. However, instead of what you would typically think, that someone pointing a finger at you is offensive, Spike instead would point his finger upward. I\u2019ve actually not seen that move since I was a little boy and my mother was telling me \u201cno.\u201d By the simple point of his finger as I was talking, it politely signaled for me to pause. It was ridiculously effective and didn\u2019t feel as if he was being rude, at all. To experiment, I used the upward finger pointing move in 3 conversations since the interview and it\u2019s like a magic wand. Whoever you\u2019re talking to just automatically stops talking (I suggest using this sparingly).\n  8. Use the Power Pause\nGoogle any video interview of Spike and you\u2019ll see he does something with his delivery that few people do, especially on a televised interview. He pauses, at will. On TV, at live events, on podcasts, any situation with time limitations, people normally don\u2019t slow down, they actually speed up their cadence. Not only that, from advice I\u2019ve received from some of the best TV producers in the business, the key with interviews is to talk succinctly and drop quick (verbal) bombs \u2013 this reasoning comes from the fact TV is sound bite driven so if you say something quick and clever, chances are it\u2019ll make additional clips of the show (like a commercial tease). No person I\u2019ve ever interviewed has defied this law, except Spike Lee. The funny thing is that a \u201cpower pause\u201d is a technique many interviewers not interviewees use (I first learned about the power pause from watching Barbara Walters. She is notorious for asking a question, getting an answer, and not responding to the answer and like magic, the interviewee sensing the silence, delves deeper in their answer and gives up something they hadn\u2019t shared before). So with the power pause at his disposal, Spike had another tool to control the conversation.\n  9. Don\u2019t Use Fillers\u2026Ever.\nSpike delivered a filler free interview. The bottom line is that the use of \u201cumm,\u201d \u201cyeah,\u201d \u201clike,\u201d etc., destroys the appearance of confidence in your subject matter as well as yourself.\n  10. Make No Apologies\nName drop coming in 3, 2, 1\u2026I remember Oprah telling me that every person she ever interviewed asked her the same question afterwards, \u201cHow did I do?\u201d Over the past 2 years, having interviewed about 60 very prominent artists, business leaders, and change agents, that same question came up, as well. Inevitably, at some point after the interview, the interviewee would lean in close to me, nearly whispering and ask, \u201cPaul, how did I do?\u201d Yesterday, the streak ended. When our interview wrapped, Spike wished my Georgetown basketball team well, thanked me for the interview, and that was that. He gave not even the slight appearance of concern for my impression of the quality of his interview. I respect that. It\u2019s like Kobe Bryant walking off the court and asking someone \u201cwas my game okay?\u201d Power players don\u2019t need a confirmation \u2013 they know if they crushed it or got crushed. Now, is feedback important? Of course it is. But if your primary goal is to control the room, what\u2019s the need for feedback when you already know you\u2019re a legend.\nLike this post?

The most successful people in the world share the following pattern in common: They have ONE thing that sits on their heart, which they embrace (no matter how trivial) as a sole passion. Then, over many years, the ONE passion is developed and ultimately becomes ONE world class skill. Then, that ONE world class skill is applied and opens the doors to an endless number of opportunities to change the world.\nCase in point, meet Gilbert Tuhabonye.\nGilbert's ONE passion is running. Gilbert is a long distance runner born in Songa, Burundi, whose early love for track and field helped him win the Burundi National Championship in the men's 400 and 800 meters while only a junior in high school. This passion helped save his life.\nOn October 21, 1993, members of the Hutu tribe invaded Gilbert's high school and captured the students of the Tutsi tribe. Those not immediately killed were beaten and burned alive in a nearby building. After nine hours buried beneath burning bodies, Gilbert managed to escape and outrun his captors to the safety of a nearby hospital. He was the lone survivor.\nHe came to Texas and kept competing, honing his skills. Recruited by Abilene Christian University, Gilbert earned All-American honors six times. After graduation he moved to Austin, where by all accounts he is the most popular running coach in the city. To drill for water in Burundi, he cofounded the Gazelle Foundation, whose main fundraiser is -- wait for it -- \"Run for the Water,\" a sponsored run through the streets of Austin. Do you see the theme running through his life?\nFrom competitor to survivor, from college to career to charity, Gilbert Tuhabonye's passion for running became a skill that led to a profession that opened up an opportunity to give back. He's a symbol of how ONE passion can become ONE skill, and together ignite and define an extraordinary life."}][{"author": "Ryan Holiday", "headline": "An ancient guide to solving all work problems once and for all", "body": "The image of the Zen philosopher is the monk up in the green, quiet hills, or in a beautiful temple on some rocky cliff. The Stoic, on the other hand, is the antithesis of this idea. The Stoic is the man in the marketplace, the merchant on a voyage, the senator in the Forum, the soldier at the front. In other words, they are like you.\nThose jobs might not seem like one well-suited for \u201cphilosophy,\u201d but they are. And so are you. For in even the most modern seeming professions, a Stoic is able to peace and clarity. For thousands of years, Stoicism has been a tool for the ordinary and the elite alive\u2014from slaves to emperors\u2014as they sought wisdom, strength and the \u2018good life.\u2019 It was philosophy designed for action--for doers--not for the classroom.\nWhich is why it has been popular with everyone from Marcus Aurelius and Seneca (one of the richest men in Rome), to Theodore Roosevelt, Frederick the Great and Michel de Montaigne. More recently, Stoicism has been cited by investors like Tim Ferriss and executives like Jonathan Newhouse, the CEO of Cond\u00e9 Nast International. Even football coaches like Pete Carroll of the Seattle Seahawks and baseball managers like Jeff Banister of the Texas Rangers have recommended Stoicism to their players.\nHow can we follow in their timeless footsteps? How can we reap the benefits of this operating system in our own workplace? It\u2019s simple. Go to straight to the sources. Below are Stoic exercises and strategies, pulled from the new book The Daily Stoic (and daily email at DailyStoic.com), that will help you navigate your workplace with better clarity, effectiveness, and peace of mind.\nDON\u2019T MAKE THINGS HARDER THAN THEY NEED TO BE\n\u201cIf someone asks you how to write your name, would you bark out each letter? And if they get angry, would you then return the anger? Wouldn\u2019t you rather gently spell out each letter for them? So then, remember in life that your duties are the sum of individual acts. Pay attention to each of these as you do your duty . . . just methodically complete your task.\u201d\u2014Marcus Aurelius, Meditations, 6.26\nHere\u2019s a common scenario. You\u2019re working with a frustrating coworker or a difficult boss. They ask you to do something and, because you dislike the messenger, you immediately object. There\u2019s this problem or that one, or their request is obnoxious and rude. So you tell them, \u201cNo, I\u2019m not going to do it.\u201d Then they retaliate by not doing something that you had previously asked of them. And so the conflict escalates.\nMeanwhile, if you could step back and see it objectively, you\u2019d probably see that not everything they\u2019re asking for is unreasonable. In fact, some of it is pretty easy to do or is, at least, agreeable. And if you did it, it might make the rest of the tasks a bit more tolerable too. Pretty soon, you\u2019ve done the entire thing.\nLife (and our job) is difficult enough. Let\u2019s not make it harder by getting emotional about insignificant matters or digging in for battles we don\u2019t actually care about. Let\u2019s not let emotion get in the way of kathe\u0302kon, the simple, appropriate actions on the path to virtue.\nIMPOSSIBLE WITHOUT YOUR CONSENT\n\u201cToday I escaped from the crush of circumstances, or better put, I threw them out, for the crush wasn\u2019t from outside me but in my own assumptions.\u201d\u2014Marcus Aurelius, Meditations, 9.13\nOn tough days we might say, \u201cMy work is overwhelming,\u201d or \u201cMy boss is really frustrating.\u201d If only we could understand that this is impossible. Someone can\u2019t frustrate you, work can\u2019t overwhelm you-these are external objects, and they have no access to your mind. Those emotions you feel, as real as they are, come from the inside, not the outside.\nThe Stoics use the word hypole\u0302psis, which means \u201ctaking up\u201d\u2014of perceptions, thoughts, and judgments by our mind. What we assume, what we willingly generate in our mind, that\u2019s on us. We can\u2019t blame other people for making us feel stressed or frustrated any more than we can blame them for our jealousy. The cause is within us. They\u2019re just the target.\nA PROPER FRAME OF MIND\n\u201cFrame your thoughts like this\u2014you are an old person, you won\u2019t let yourself be enslaved by this any longer, no longer pulled like a puppet by every impulse, and you\u2019ll stop complaining about your present fortune or dreading the future.\u201d \u2014Marcus Aurelius, Meditations, 2.2\nWe resent the person who comes in and tries to boss us around. Don\u2019t tell me how to dress, how to think, how to do my job, how to live. This is because we are independent, self-sufficient people.\nOr at least that\u2019s what we tell ourselves.\nYet if someone says something we disagree with, something inside us tells us we have to argue with them. If there\u2019s a plate of cookies in front of us, we have to eat them. If someone does something we dislike, we have to get mad about it. When something bad happens, we have to be sad, depressed, or worried. But if something good happens a few minutes later, all of a sudden we\u2019re happy, excited, and want more.\nWe would never let another person jerk us around the way we let our impulses do. It\u2019s time we start seeing it that way\u2014that we\u2019re not puppets that can be made to dance this way or that way just because we feel like it. We should be the ones in control, not our emotions, because we are independent, self-sufficient people.\nKEEP IT SIMPLE\n\u201cAt every moment keep a sturdy mind on the task at hand, as a Roman and human being, doing it with strict and simple dignity, affection, freedom, and justice\u2014giving yourself a break from all other considerations. You can do this if you approach each task as if it is your last, giving up every distraction, emotional subversion of reason, and all drama, vanity, and complaint over your fair share. You can see how mastery over a few things makes it possible to live an abundant and devout life\u2014for, if you keep watch over these things, the gods won\u2019t ask for more.\u201d \u2014 Marcus Aurelius, Meditations, 2.5\nEach day presents the chance to overthink things. What should I wear? Do they like me? Am I eating well enough? What\u2019s next for me in life? Is my boss happy with my work?\nToday, let\u2019s focus just on what\u2019s in front of us. We\u2019ll follow the dictum that New England Patriots coach Bill Belichick gives his players: \u201cDo your job.\u201d Like a Roman, like a good soldier, like a master of our craft. We don\u2019t need to get lost in a thousand other distractions or in other people\u2019s business.\nMarcus says to approach each task as if it were your last, because it very well could be. And even if it isn\u2019t, botching what\u2019s right in front of you doesn\u2019t help anything. Find clarity in the simplicity of doing.\nNEVER DO ANYTHING OUT OF HABIT\n\u201cSo in the majority of other things, we address circumstances not in accordance with the right assumptions, but mostly by following wretched habit. Since all that I\u2019ve said is the case, the person in training must seek to rise above, so as to stop seeking out pleasure and steering away from pain; to stop clinging to living and abhorring death; and in the case of property and money, to stop valuing receiving over giving.\u201d\u2014Musonius Rufus, Lectures, 6.25.5\u201311                                   \nA worker is asked: \u201cWhy did you do it this way?\u201d The answer, \u201cBecause that\u2019s the way we\u2019ve always done things.\u201d The answer frustrates every good boss and sets the mouth of every entrepreneur watering. The worker has stopped thinking and is mindlessly operating out of habit. The business is ripe for disruption by a competitor, and the worker will probably get fired by any thinking boss.\nWe should apply the same ruthlessness to our own habits. In fact, we are studying philosophy precisely to break ourselves of rote behavior. Find what you do out of rote memory or routine. Ask yourself: Is this really the best way to do it? Know why you do what you do\u2014do it for the right reasons.                                                            \nYOUR CAREER IS NOT A LIFE SENTENCE\n\u201cHow disgraceful is the lawyer whose dying breath passes while at court, at an advanced age, pleading for unknown litigants and still seeking the approval of ignorant spectators.\u201d\u2014Seneca, On the Brevity of Life, 20.2\nEvery few years, a sad spectacle is played out in the news. An old millionaire, still lord of his business empire, is taken to court. Shareholders and family members go to court to argue that he is no longer mentally competent to make decisions\u2014that the patriarch is not fit to run his own company and legal affairs. Because this powerful person refused to ever relinquish control or develop a succession plan, he is subjected to one of life\u2019s worst humiliations: the public exposure of his most private vulnerabilities.\nWe must not get so wrapped up in our work that we think we\u2019re immune from the reality of aging and life. Who wants to be the person who can never let go? Is there so little meaning in your life that your only pursuit is work until you\u2019re eventually carted off in a coffin?\nTake pride in your work. But it is not all.                                                            \nPROTECT YOUR PEACE OF MIND\n\u201cKeep constant guard over your perceptions, for it is no small thing you are protecting, but your respect, trustworthiness and steadi- ness, peace of mind, freedom from pain and fear, in a word your freedom. For what would you sell these things?\u201d\u2014Epictetus, Discourses, 4.3.6b\u20138\nThe dysfunctional job that stresses you out, a contentious relationship, life in the spotlight. Stoicism, because it helps us manage and think through our emotional reactions, can make these kinds of situations easier to bear. It can help you manage and mitigate the triggers that seem to be so constantly tripped.\nBut here\u2019s a question: Why are you subjecting yourself to this? Is this really the environment you were made for? To be provoked by nasty emails and an endless parade of workplace problems? Our adrenal glands can handle only so much before they become exhausted. Shouldn\u2019t you preserve them for life-and-death situations?\nSo yes, use Stoicism to manage these difficulties. But don\u2019t forget to ask: Is this really the life I want? Every time you get upset, a little bit of life leaves the body. Are these really the things on which you want to spend that priceless resource? Don\u2019t be afraid to make a change\u2014a big one.\nRyan Holiday is the bestselling author of The Obstacle Is the Wayand Ego is the Enemy, whose forthcoming book, The Daily Stoic: 366 Meditations on Wisdom, Perseverance, and the Art of Living, will be released on October 18.

Editorial decided it would no longer accept columns of this nature on this topic. I have the utmost respect for the leadership at the Observer, but I respectfully disagree with that decision. Anyone who would like to republish the article is welcome to.\nDad, let me start this letter by saying that it isn\u2019t my intention to embarrass you. I find that I can express myself in writing better than I can when we talk on the phone (in fact, if anyone likes this piece, that will be, in its own way, a compliment to you\u2014I developed as a writer sitting alone in my room as a kid, trying to find ways to respond to your overwhelming parental logic) and so when I heard that you were leaning towards voting for Donald Trump, I felt inclined to put my thoughts down so they would be clear.\nIt's fitting that I would write to you here anyway, because the Observer has its own father issues when it comes to Donald Trump (Mr. Trump is the publisher\u2019s father-in-law.) This is a newspaper that, despite its sincere and passionate reporting on anti-Semitism and its frontline investigations on the rise of Russia as a national security threat, has found itself endorsing and defending Trump...even as he veers dangerously towards courting anti-Semitism and justifying Russia\u2019s authoritarian methods (when he isn\u2019t complimenting the tactics of Saddam Hussein.) Having been associated with my own fair share of controversial people, I empathize with the position, Jared Kushner, the paper\u2019s owner, must be in.\nI get that elections are complicated. Yet I cannot help but feel that the right choice has become increasingly simple. Not easy, but simple.\nThe choice is simple because it\u2019s hard for me to think of a single person who violates more of what you taught me as a child. The case against Donald Trump as a candidate\u2014even as a person worthy of two seconds of anyone\u2019s serious attention in our busy lives\u2014is clear to me precisely because of what I learned from you, Dad.\nI remember the trips we took to Angel Island in the San Francisco Bay. This is where people like Grandma and Grandpa first arrived in America, you told us. It was here that they stopped on their way to the American Dream, fleeing the terror of their homeland and hoping for a better life. You taught us that it was honorable and brave to be an immigrant and that what made America special was that we opened our arms to these people. Do you remember taking us to the Civil War battlefields and explaining how many of the men who fought and died in that war were fresh off the boat, paying for their citizenship to this country in blood\u2014dying to eradicate the scourge of slavery, a plague they had nothing to do with creating in the first place? That was what made America great, you said.\nBut you didn\u2019t just teach us to admire white European immigrants either. It was from you that I learned to respect just how hard Latino, Asian, and Middle Eastern immigrants worked to make a life for themselves here. You told me what it was like picking fruit in the California heat, and explained how they took jobs that other people weren\u2019t willing to do\u2014because they wanted to support their families just like everyone else. You also took the time to explain how many immigrants were entrepreneurs\u2014starting restaurants and small businesses from donut shops to car dealerships (we\u2019ve invested together in a few of those small businesses) and how their efforts made the world better for everyone.\nWhen I was in Austria a few years ago, I called Mom and had her do some research to find the location of the refugee camp that Grandpa was sent to when he was just a little younger than I am now. It\u2019s an apartment complex now, which I guess goes to show how quickly we can forget the kind of thinking that creates such horrors. Experiences like these\u2014they color the way I see the world, which is why, I imagine, you encouraged us to travel and study history. Those trips are why I find it so repulsive to hear Donald Trump talk about how Mexicans are \u201crapists\u201d and how his solution is building a literal wall\u2014 \u201cWe\u2019re going to have a big, beautiful wall that nobody\u2019s crossing\u201d\u2014to keep these kinds of people out. I find it disgusting to hear him talk about banning Muslims from America. That\u2019s not what you taught me. That\u2019s not how this country is supposed to work. Mom and half our relatives wouldn\u2019t be here if it was.\nI told you that a few weeks ago we had someone out at the house to repair some damage from the floods. As I was walking the property with the guy, he asked me if I owned a gun. I said that I did\u2014this is Texas after all. \u201cGood,\u201d he said, \u201cyou\u2019ll need to have something when them sand niggers come and try to take this country from us.\u201d Then he told me about how he was glad Donald Trump was speaking the truth and taking things in the right direction.\nI know you don\u2019t agree with this man. And I don\u2019t think it\u2019s fair to hold a candidate accountable for every fringe group that attaches themselves to their platform. But doesn\u2019t it alarm you to see a candidate who seems to stoke these kinds of fires\u2014directly or indirectly? Surely you must be shaking your head at Trump\u2019s repeated refusal to distance himself from these people.\nAs a police officer, you worked for a time in the hate crimes division. You\u2019ve seen the horrible things that prejudice and ignorance can do. I remember you once told me that the way the Ku Klux Klan recruited people in our hometown was by convincing white people that they were being attacked and that their way of life was under siege. C\u2019mon Dad, is that not eerily similar to some of Trump\u2019s campaign tactics? Why else would he have refused to immediately disavow the support of David Duke and other white supremacists? What possible purpose did he have to insinuate that President Obama was a Muslim, that he was not born in America? Or question a Mexican-American judge\u2019s loyalty to the law and to the Constitution?\nA few years ago, Donald Trump went on live television and talked about nice his daughter Ivanka\u2019s body was, saying how if he wasn\u2019t her father, he\u2019d probably be dating her. It was disturbing then, but we all say things that come off utterly differently than intended. Except last year, speaking to a Rolling Stone reporter, Trump said the exact same thing again. \u201cYeah, she's really something, and what a beauty, that one,\u201d he told the journalist. \u201cIf I weren't happily married and, ya know, her father...\u201d\nYou have a daughter (and now a daughter-in-law). Can you imagine saying anything like that about them? What would you say to one of your friends who uttered something half that creepy? You\u2019ve been married for thirty years. You taught me about respecting women, about the importance of marriage and fidelity. This man, he doesn\u2019t stand for any of that. On the contrary, he refers to women he doesn\u2019t like as \u201cfat pigs\u201d and \u201cdogs.\u201d He attacks them and when they press him on the issues, says it\u2019s because they\u2019re probably menstruating.\nYou\u2019ve protected presidents and other heads of state as part of your job. Can you imagine any of them behaving that way? I remember our family trip to the White House in middle school\u2014even though you disagreed with the man who was President, you spoke of the office with such reverence and dignity that we felt honored just to visit. I left that day with exactly the sense of admiration and respect for the office that I think you hoped we\u2019d feel. I remember another trip to New York where we walked by the Trump Tower. What\u2019s that, I asked? You just shook your head and said, \u201cTacky.\u201d\nBefore he died, Grandad gave me his copy of John McCain\u2019s memoir Faith of My Fathers and said that I might like to read it. It wasn\u2019t until years later that I got around to it. Did you know that when John McCain was trapped in that horrible North Vietnamese prison, his captors offered to let him go several times? McCain\u2019s father was the commander of all US forces in the Vietnam theater and the Vietcong thought by giving his son an easy way out, they could show that Americans were cowards. Despite the repeated torture that he\u2019d already undergone, despite the fact that McCain ached to go home, he refused. He stayed because he refused to embarrass his country or abandon his comrades\u2014death was better than dishonor. I think that\u2019s the kind of lesson that Grandad was trying to pass along to me. I know you voted for McCain in 2000 and in 2008 in part for that very reason. I don\u2019t agree with many of McCain\u2019s politics but I hope that when tested, I could exhibit one iota of the courage that that man has.\nAnd yet here we are discussing a Republican candidate who insulted John McCain in front of the entire world\u2014claiming that John McCain isn\u2019t a hero because he was captured and spent time in a POW camp. Donald Trump, who got out of serving with a series of draft deferments, said he only likes the veterans \u201cthat weren\u2019t captured.\u201d That this pathetic encounter has been nearly forgotten in the campaign is not because Donald addressed it or apologized, but rather because nearly every day since he either said something worse or piled on with some other obscene gesture or gaffe.\nWouldn\u2019t just a single one of these remarks have run a candidate out of the race in a normal election cycle? Wouldn\u2019t have these repeated and ridiculous lapses in judgement effectively end the campaign for anyone in any election anywhere in the civilized world? I\u2019ve tried to think about why we\u2019ve been so forgiving of Donald Trump. Is it because his opponent is a woman? Does it say something about us? Have we all collectively lost our sense of where the line is and we\u2019re just hoping that someone will finally draw it for us?\nI realize that most of these issues I\u2019ve brought up are personal ones, but isn\u2019t all politics personal? That\u2019s a lesson I learned from you, too. I remember asking whether you supported the Republican or the Democrat candidate in some local election when I was a kid, having heard some friends\u2019 parents talking about it. You told me that people got too caught up in party affiliation and that what really mattered was character and whether you could work together with the person (and whether they could do the job). That\u2019s how I\u2019ve tried to think all my life. I\u2019m thinking about it now that it really matters.\nThe baffling reality is that when it comes to Trump, it\u2019s difficult to critique him on much besides his personality and (lack of) character\u2014because that is all there is. Maybe you can make an exception for some of these comments, I\u2019ve certainly said dumb things before. We all have. Maybe we chalk them up to media mischaracterizations as some of the Trump supporters I know have (given what I write about in this column, I\u2019m the last one to think the media is completely fair or trustworthy). But even making allowances for that, I know for a fact, no matter what the talking heads on TV are trying to tell moderate conservatives, is that you and he stand very far apart on most of the economic principles and civil policies in which you have always believed.\nI remember long trips in the car and the conversation we had about civics and governance. The basics you taught me about the free market, about capitalism, about the government staying out of people\u2019s business. Now that I\u2019m an adult, I\u2019ve come to fully understand and truly appreciate why you taught me these lessons. I see how they\u2019ve contributed to my own success. I also see how the few policies or firm beliefs Trump might actually have fly in the face of all of them.\nBesides repeatedly donating money to Democratic (and Republican) candidates from whom he tried to get favors, Donald Trump has said publicly that there should be \u201csome form of punishment\u201d for women who get abortions (though he later backtracked under pressure). He\u2019s advocated economic policies that the experts say will start trade wars with China and Mexico. He cheered Brexit because it might drive traffic to his Scottish golf courses (the definition of a conflict of interest), has hinted at using federal resources to go after personal enemies like Jeff Bezos, admits he would continue to let his children run his numerous international businesses while in office, supports \u201copening up\u201d our libel laws to reduce freedom of the press, and apparently believes that global warming is a lie created by China.\nI suppose it would be one thing if these beliefs came from some unique ideological framework but we both know they don\u2019t. He\u2019s a man who reacts, a man who speaks before he thinks (something you always taught me to avoid). These aren\u2019t the meticulously crafted positions of an educated leader surrounded by qualified and informed policy experts\u2014as Trump famously said, he advises himself. There is a quote I read from Winston Churchill recently. During World War One, someone asked why he was reading the work of a certain anti-war poet. \u201cI am not a bit afraid of Siegfried Sassoon,\u201d Churchill said, \u201cThat man can think. I am only afraid of people who cannot think.\u201d\nI think that\u2019s why I am so scared, Dad. That\u2019s why I am writing you this letter. I don\u2019t think this man has done a lick of thinking in years\u2014except about himself and the irrational prejudices and fears which rule his increasingly erratic and bizarre life.\nIf my understanding of where you sit it is correct, you are inclined to agree with most of the criticisms I've just made and yet are swayed by very few of them. As is true for a lot of Americans, I know you\u2019ve been disturbed with a lot what Trump has said and wish sincerely that someone else was running in his place. The problem is\u2014the reason you can\u2019t help but feel pressure to give him the benefit of the doubt or vote for him reluctantly\u2014is that you feel a profound and real distrust towards Hillary Clinton.\nI wasn\u2019t old enough to experience the anger and disillusionment that the Clintons brought to the White House. I get the sense that you see them as thoughtless, careless self-aggrandizers who believe themselves to be above the law. Given the evidence, this is a more than fair assessment. You have real, negative experiences with the last administration and the vague memories of the scandals and noise of that era probably makes another four years seem unappealing. I get it.\nIt was J.K. Galbraith who said that politics was a matter of choosing between the disastrous and the unpalatable. I don\u2019t disagree with you we are dealing with less than ideal options. But surely, unpalatable is better than disastrous.\nThen again, no one is saying you have to vote for Hillary. I\u2019m just asking if you could not vote for Donald Trump. Vote for a third party candidate. For a write-in, you could take a page from Trump\u2019s people, who when they initially had trouble finding people to speak on his behalf at the convention, apparently just put \u201cGeorge Washington\u201d in as a placeholder. Or, what about just not voting in this election? Is that not a powerful statement in its own right? One does not need to endorse disaster just because they resent unpalatable.\nMitt Romney has said that he was finally motivated to get involved in this election when his son asked him, \u201cWhen the grandkids ask \u2018What did you do to stop Donald Trump?\u2019 what are you going to say?\u2019\u201d\nI was so happy to be able to tell you a few weeks ago that you have your first grandchild on the way and that he\u2019s expected to arrive just three days before the election. I think that\u2019s why I am writing this letter too, as my way of asking myself what am I going to do to make sure the world he enters is just a little bit better than the one I came into thirty years ago. I guess I am writing this letter to ask that you, as his grandfather, do what you can to ensure the same.\nSo that when he does ask, not that many years in the future, looking back at what was hopefully just a painful aberration in this nation\u2019s history, we both have a good answer to how we faced this challenge in front of us. And that we acted\u2014despite any personal feelings, or complications or doubts\u2014with principle and courage.\nDad, please don\u2019t vote for Donald Trump. Everything you've taught me about what is wrong in the world is everything that man represents. And if you won't do it for me, do it for your grandchild. Give him something to be proud of\u2014and thankful for.\nYour Loving Son,\nRyan\nRyan Holiday is the best-selling author of Ego is the Enemy and three other books.

His name has been so obscured and forgotten by history that he makes an underappreciated general like George Marshall seem positively famous. At least they named the Marshall Plan after George.\nAs Rome\u2019s highest ranking commander under the Byzan\u00adtine emperor Justinian, Belisarius saved Western civilization on at least three occasions. As Rome collapsed and the seat of the empire moved to Constantinople, Belisarius was the only bright light in a dark time for Christianity. Chances are, you haven\u2019t even heard of him.\nAll the same, the man won brilliant victories at Dara, Carthage, Naples, Sic\u00adily, and Constantinople. He saved the emperor\u2019s life when it was threatened by a riotous mob. He reclaimed farflung territories and recaptured Rome for the first time since it fell\u200a\u2014\u200aall before he was 40.\nHis thanks? He was not given public thanks or celebrations. Instead, he was repeatedly second guessed by the emperor and at the end of his illustrious career, Belisarius was stripped of his wealth, and according to the legend, blinded, and forced to beg in the streets to survive.\nHistorians, scholars, and artists have lamented and argued about this treatment for centuries. They\u2019re rightfully outraged at the ungratefulness, and the pettiness this great and unusual man was subjected to. But guess who never complained about it, even when he had the chance? Belisarius.\nIt seems that he was content to simply do his job. That he took pride in doing it well. And that was enough.\nFor Belisarius, this attitude came from a sense of Christian duty which allowed him to put up with the difficulties inherent in his position. Today, while we hope not to be exposed to this kind of preposterously unjust treatment whether at the hands of our bosses, colleagues or government, we nevertheless must understand that thriving in the real world\u200a\u2014\u200aespecially the creative world\u200a\u2014\u200awill require a similar mindset. Not a religious devotion, but a commitment to the work, as opposed to the rewards.\nThough obvious, we often forget that when we work on a project\u200a\u2014\u200awhetherit\u2019s a book or a business or otherwise\u200a\u2014\u200aat a certain point, that thing leaves our hands and enters the realm of the world. It is judged, received, and acted on by other people (whether they are called audiences, bosses, clients, critics, customers or judges). Their response is outside our control.\nIn other words, even if we do everything right, the reaction might be failure, disrespect, jealousy, or even a resounding yawn from the world. If we are motivated by the wrong thing\u200a\u2014\u200aif ego holds sway\u200a\u2014\u200athis response will crush us.\nI\u2019ve seen it happen a hundred times. I\u2019ve done it myself too.\nBelisarius could win his battles. He could lead his men. He could determine his personal ethics. He could not make the Emperor like and appreciate him. He had no ability to control whether a powerful dicta\u00adtor would treat him well.\nThe same is true for our work. How we respond to this dilemma determines who we are as people as well as the quality of what we will create.\nCan we do the right thing even if it\u2019s not recognized? Will we work hard for something that can be taken away from us? Will we lash out and be wronged just because someone else doesn\u2019t play by the rules?\nI released my book two weeks ago. I sold more copies than I ever expected to sell\u200a\u2014\u200athat\u2019s a good thing. Yet I did not appear on the New York TimesBestseller List (despite rightfully earning a place there) or the Wall Street Journal Bestseller List (where my book should have been number one). Why did this happen? I\u2019m not sure.\nI do know that there are certain games it is possible to play with the list and I chose not to play them. I know that I might have done something that pissed the New York Times off a few years ago\u200a\u2014\u200amaybe they\u2019re still mad about it. I also know that my publisher messed some reporting stuff up that might have impacted my chances on one of the lists. (I did hit the nationalUSA Today list and a few other international lists).\nIn any case, I did all the right things. I wrote the book. I hustled my ass off. I didn\u2019t cheat. And the reward?\nI was screwed over and deprived of something that was mine\u200a\u2014\u200athat would be very good for my career.\nExcept that is a preposterously selfish and short sighted way to look at it. First off, because I actually achieved the thing that the list is supposed to recognize (selling well). In fact, I sold more than I expected to sell, reached a lot of people, and got recognized in some places but not others. But those are not things to take pride in. It\u2019s better to find satisfaction in knowing that I wrote the best book that I was capable of writing. Knowing that I pushed myself continually through the process and emerged better for it. Those are two things that were entirely in my control. If my happiness was dependent on everything else going my way, then I would not only be a hypocrite, but a miserable person most of the time.\nI\u2019m not saying that it\u2019s easy to think this way. I\u2019m not saying that I haven\u2019t had to struggle with my anger about it a dozen times since I first found out. But what else am I going to do? Throw a tantrum? Where will that get me?\nWe need to cultivate the humility and discipline necessary to accept that we have only minimal control over the rewards for our work and effort\u200a\u2014\u200aother people\u2019s validation, recognition, rewards.\nThink of all the activists who will find that they can only advance their cause so far. The leaders who are assassinated before their work is done. The inventors whose ideas lan\u00adguish \u201cahead of their time.\u201d According to society\u2019s main metrics, these people were not rewarded for their work. Should they have not done it? Should they not be kind, not work hard, not produce, because there is a chance it wouldn\u2019t be reciprocated? Should they have done the wrong thing instead?\nC\u2019mon.\nYet in our most egotistical and wounded moments\u200a\u2014\u200awhen struggling with our earsplitting \u201cexpectation hangover\u201d\u200a\u2014\u200aevery one of us has considered doing pre\u00adcisely that. Wanted to say: \u201cFuck \u2019em, they don\u2019t appreciate me anyway.\u201d\nIt might feel good in the short term, but it\u2019s awful in the long term.\nIt\u2019s far better (and more resilient) when doing good work is sufficient. When fulfilling our own standards is what fills us with pride and self respect. When the effort\u200a\u2014\u200anot the results, good or bad\u200a\u2014\u200ais enough.\nIt calls to mind the encounter between Alexander the Great and the famous Cynic philosopher Diogenes. Allegedly, Alexander approached Diogenes, who was lying down, enjoying the summer air, and stood over him and asked what he, the most powerful man in the world, might be able to do for this notoriously poor man. Diogenes could have asked for anything. What he requested was epic: \u201cStop blocking my sun.\u201d Even two thousand years later we can feel exactly where in the solar plexus that must have hit Alexander, a man who always wanted to prove how important he was. As the author Robert Louis Stevenson later observed about this meeting, \u201cIt is a sore thing to have labored along and scaled arduous hilltops, and when all is done, find humanity indifferent to your achievement.\u201d\nWe need to try for that as well. Because maybe our parents will never be impressed. Maybe our girlfriend won\u2019t care. Maybe the investor won\u2019t see the numbers. Maybe the audi\u00adence won\u2019t clap. But we have to be able to push through. We can\u2019t let that be what motivates us.\nHow do you carry on then? How do you take pride in yourself and your work? John Wooden\u2019s advice to his players says it: Change the definition of success. \u201cSuccess is peace of mind, which is a direct result of self satisfaction in knowing you made the effort to do your best to become the best that you are capable of becoming.\u201d \u201cAmbition,\u201d Marcus Aurelius reminded himself, \u201cmeans tying your well\u00adbeing to what other people say or do . . . Sanity means tying it to your own actions.\u201d In other words: Do your work. Do it well. Let that be the end of your concern.\nAnd understand, that even so\u200a\u2014\u200athere will be times when you will be unappreciated. You will be sabotaged. You will experience surprising failures. Your expectations will not be met. You will lose. You will fail.\nRecognition and rewards\u200a\u2014\u200athose must be extra. John Kennedy Toole\u2019s great book A Confederacy of Dunces was universally turned down by publishers, news that so broke his heart that he later committed suicide in his car on an empty road in Biloxi, Mississippi. After his death, his mother discovered the book, advocated on its behalf until it was published, and it eventually won the Pulitzer Prize.\nThink about that for a second. What changed between those submissions? Nothing. The book was the same. It was equally great when Toole had it in manuscript form and had fought with editors about it as it was when the book was published, sold copies, and won awards. If only he could have realized this, it would have saved him so much heart\u00adbreak. He couldn\u2019t, but from his painful example we can at least see how arbitrary many of the breaks in life are.\nThis is why we are the only people who should define what success looks like\u200a\u2014\u200aand that that success should not depend on externals. It should be on us.\nThe world is, after all, indifferent to what we humans \u201cwant.\u201d What can go wrong will. If we persist in wanting, in needing that to not happen?\nOnly misery and disappointment awaits.\nBut if we can find joy and satisfaction in the work? Well that can be ours right now.\nRyan Holiday is the bestselling author of Ego is the Enemy and three other books.

They said: \u201cJust make your boss look good.\u201d\nNow in Hollywood, a world of big egos obsessed with getting credit, there is really no other way for someone just starting out to survive. But it turns out that across industries and across history,aspiring young men and women have used this same approach to get ahead.\nThey realized that the best way to advance their own interests was to do something simple but counterintuitive: provide opportunities for other people. Not only because it makes their boss look good, but because it creates its own opportunities for the pupil to learn and explore.\nFor instance, many people know that as a young man Benjamin Franklin published numerous letters written under fake names like Silence Dogwood. What they don\u2019t know is that Franklin wrote those letters, sub\u00admitted them by sliding them under the print\u00adshop door, and received absolutely no credit for them until much later in his life. In fact, it was his brother, the owner, who profited from their immense popularity, regularly running them on the front page of his newspaper. Franklin was playing the long game, though \u2014 learning how public opinion worked, generating awareness of what he believed in, crafting his style and tone and wit. It was a strategy he used time and again over his career \u2014 once even publishing in his compet\u00aditor\u2019s paper in order to undermine a third competitor \u2014 for Franklin saw the constant benefit in making other people look good and letting them take credit for his ideas.\nOne must master their ego to be able to completely ignore getting credit, getting ahead, even throwing out what your job is supposed to be on paper. It takes a special type of humility to focus your energy on finding, presenting, and facilitating opportunities that help other people succeed.\nBut this is essential.\nBill Belichick, the now four-time Super Bowl-winning coach of the New England Patriots, made his way up the ranks of the NFL by loving and mastering how to do the one thing that coaches hated at the time: analyzing film.\nHis first job in professional football for the Baltimore Colts was one he volunteered to take without pay \u2014 and his insights, which provided ammunition and critical strategies for the game, were attributed exclusively to the other public-facing coaches.  \u201cHe was like a sponge, tak\u00ading it all in, listening to everything,\u201d one coach said. \u201cYou gave him an assignment and he disappeared into a room and you didn\u2019t see him again until it was done, and then he wanted to do more,\u201d said another.\nThis gave him two things: first, a role in the organization that allowed him to thrive and carve out space for himself, two, an understanding of the game that today cannot be matched. And today, Beli\u00adchick has no problem getting paid.\nA few years ago there was some controversy because Sheryl Sandberg, the COO of Facebook, was looking for an unpaid intern. How dare she?! bloggers shouted and yelled. She can afford to pay! Of course, she could. But can you afford to pass on that opportunity?\nThe attitude of the angry, unappreciated genius\u2014that gets us nowhere. Nowhere but living back at home with our parents because \u201cwe\u2019re overqualified\u201d for an entry-level position. Nowhere but a reputation for being a person who doesn\u2019t work well with others, who is entitled and obnoxious.\nMeanwhile, the apprenticeship model is responsible for some of the greatest art in the history of the world\u2014everyone from Michelangelo to Leonardo da Vinci to Benjamin Franklin has been forced to navigate such a system. The greatest networkers in the world practice their art by delivering extraordinary amounts of value to everyone they meet.\nIt\u2019s because they realize what most people\u2019s ego\u2019s prevent them from seeing: that by serving and helping others now, you\u2019re really helping yourself.\nI\u2019ve seen this in my own life. For many years, I was a research assistant and apprentice for the author Robert Greene, creator of the 48 Laws of Power. My job was to contribute little bits and pieces to his books that 99% of the public would have no idea I was responsible for. But I loved it. I did it for years.\nWorking in that system, also taught me the fatal consequences of ego. One slip up, one false belief that you were indispensable to the project, and the door would be shut on you. Important people don\u2019t have time for that. But the quieter and more helpful I could be? The more opportunities I had to contribute. The more I learned. The more trust I was given.\nSlowly I developed my own abilities and was able to pursue my own career. I\u2019m writing this article (and now my own books) because of it.\nThere is an old saying, \u201cSay little, do much.\u201d What we really ought to do is update and apply a version of that to our early approach. Be lesser, do more. Imagine if for every person you met, you thought of some way to help them, something you could do for them? And you looked at it in a way that entirely benefited them and not you. The cumu\u00adlative effect this would have over time would be profound: You\u2019d learn a great deal by solving diverse problems. You\u2019d develop a reputation for being indispensable. You\u2019d have countless new relationships. You\u2019d have an enormous bank of favors to call upon down the road.\nThat\u2019s what this strategy is about \u2014 helping yourself by helping others. Making a concerted effort to trade your short\u00ad term gratification for a longer\u00adterm payoff. Whereas everyone else wants to get credit and be \u201crespected,\u201d you can forget credit. You can forget it so hard that you\u2019re glad when others get it instead of you \u2014 that was your aim, after all. Consider it all an investment.\nThis approach is here for you at anytime. There is no expiration date on it either. It\u2019s one of the few that age does not limit \u2014 on either side, young or old. You can start at any time \u2014 before you have a job, before you\u2019re hired and while you\u2019re doing something else, or if you\u2019re starting something new or find yourself inside an organization with\u00adout strong allies or support. You may even find that there\u2019s no reason to ever stop doing it, even once you\u2019ve graduated to heading your own projects. Let it become natural and permanent \u2014 always, always find opportunities for other people.\nThis piece is adapted from the book Ego is the Enemy, published by Penguin/Portfolio.\nRyan Holiday is the bestselling author of Ego Is The Enemy and three other books.

Stuck in a job we don\u2019t like. Stuck across town because a meeting was cancelled. Stuck with an obligation that someone else signed us up for. Stuck in a failing company. \nWe\u2019re stuck\u2014we don\u2019t have a choice about that. But we do have a choice about something else: What will we do with this time? \nIn 1946, Malcolm X was sentenced to 10 years in prison. Even accounting for the shameful American racism and whatever systematic legal injustices existed at the time, Mal\u00adcolm X was guilty. He deserved to go to jail. And now he had roughly a decade to sit in a cage. \nAs Malcolm X entered that prison he faced that same choice. He faced what Robert Greene\u2014a man who sixty years later would find his wildly popular books banned in many federal prisons\u2014calls an \u201cAlive Time or Dead Time\u201d scenario. How would the seven years he would serve play out? What would Malcolm do with this time?                                \nAccording to Greene, there are two types of time in our lives: dead time, when people are passive and waiting, and alive time, when people are learning and acting and utiliz\u00ading every second. Every moment of failure, every moment or situation that we did not deliberately choose or control, presents this choice: Alive time. Dead time.\nWhich will it be?\nMalcolm chose alive time. He began to learn. He explored religion. He taught himself to be a reader by checking out a pencil and the dictionary from the prison library and not only consumed it from start to finish, but copied it down long\u2010hand from cover to cover. All these words he\u2019d never known existed before were transferred to his brain. \nAs he said later, \u201cFrom then until I left that prison, in every free moment I had, if I was not reading in the library, I was reading in my bunk.\u201d He read history, he read sociol\u00adogy, he read about religion, he read the classics, he read philosophers like Kant and Spinoza. Later, a reporter asked Malcolm, \u201cWhat\u2019s your alma mater?\u201d His one word answer: \u201cBooks.\u201d\nPrison became his college. He transcended confine\u00adment through the pages he absorbed. He reflected that months passed without him even thinking about being detained against his will. He had \u201cnever been so truly free in his life.\u201d \nAnd yet, here we are, stuck in our own way. Maybe you\u2019re sitting in a remedial high school class, maybe you\u2019re watching for the numbers to come in on your newest launch, maybe it\u2019s a trial separation, maybe you\u2019re stuck making smoothies or living at home while you save up money, maybe you\u2019re stuck waiting out a contract or a tour of duty. Maybe this situation is one totally of your own making, or perhaps it\u2019s just bad luck. \nThe ego in all of us wants to complain about how this situation sucks. How it\u2019s unfair. How we\u2019d rather be doing just about anything else. And it\u2019s this attitude that creates dead time we can never get back. In this way, ego is the mortal enemy of alive time. \nBut if we\u2019re humble, accepting and creative, we can transform seemingly terrible situations\u2014a prison sentence, a dysfunctional job, a bear market or depression, military conscription, a failing company\u2014 turned those circumstances into fuel for greatness.   \nWe can ask ourselves: What can I accomplish here? What can I do with this time? Think of what you have been putting off. Issues you declined to deal with. Systemic problems that felt too over\u00adwhelming to address. Dead time is revived when we use it as an opportunity to do what we\u2019ve long needed to do\u2014from having difficult conversations to squeezing in some quiet reading time. \nFrancis Scott Key wrote the poem that became the national anthem of the United States while trapped on a ship during a prisoner exchange in the War of 1812. Viktor Frankl refined his psychologies of meaning and suffering during his ordeal in three Nazi concentration camps. Not that these opportunities always come in such serious situa\u00adtions. The author Ian Fleming was on bed rest and, per doc\u00adtors\u2019 orders, forbidden from using a typewriter. They were worried he\u2019d exert himself by writing another Bond novel. So he created Chitty-Chitty-Bang-Bang: The Magical Car by hand instead. Walt Disney made his decision to become a cartoonist while laid up after stepping on a rusty nail. \n\u201cMany a serious thinker has been produced in prisons,\u201d as Robert Greene put it, \u201cwhere we have nothing to do but think.\u201d Well, at the very least, our situation can be used for that. To get some serious thinking done.\nIt\u2019s easy to angry, to be aggrieved, to be depressed or heartbroken. I don\u2019t want this. I want ______. I want it my way. But this accomplishes nothing!\nAs they say, this moment is not your life. But it is a moment in your life. How will you use it? \nLet us say, the next time we find ourselves stuck: This is an opportunity for me. I am using it for my purposes. I will not let this be dead time for me. The dead time was when we were controlled by ego. \nAs Booker T. Washington most famously put it, \u201cCast down your bucket where you are.\u201d Make use of what\u2019s around you. Even the dead time. Because while its occurrence isn\u2019t in our control. Its use, on the other hand, is. \nThis piece is adapted from Ryan Holiday\u2019s book Ego is the Enemy, published by Penguin Portfolio                                                           \nRyan Holiday is the bestselling author of Ego Is The Enemy and three other books.

But he got it from a psychiatry professor named Lionel Rosen during his time at Michigan State.\nRosen\u2019s big insight was this: sports\u2014especially football\u2014are complex. Nobody has enough brainpower or motivation to consistently manage all the variables going on in the course of a season, let alone a game. They think they do\u2014but realistically, they don\u2019t.\nThere are too many plays, too many players, too many statistics, countermoves, unpredictables, distractions. Over the course of a long playoff season, this adds up into a cognitively impossible load. Meanwhile, as Monte Burke writes in his book Saban, Rosen discovered that the average play in football lasts just seven seconds. Seven seconds\u2014that\u2019s very manageable.\n  Nick Saban, head coach of the Alabama Crimson Tide (Photo by Rodger Mallison/Fort Worth Star-Telegram/TNS via Getty Images)\nSo he posed a question: What if a team concentrated only on what they could manage? What if they took things step by step\u2014not focusing on anything but what was right in front of them and on doing it well?\nAs a result, Nick Saban doesn\u2019t focus on what every other coach focuses on, or at least not the way they do. He tells them:\n\u201cDon\u2019t think about winning the SEC Championship. Don\u2019t think about the national championship. Think about what you needed to do in this drill, on this play, in this moment. That\u2019s the process: Let\u2019s think about what we can do today, the task at hand.\u201d\nIt\u2019s this message that\u2019s been internalized by his players and his teams\u2014which together have four national championships in an eight-year span, one Mid-American Conference championship, have been crowned SEC champions 15 times and Saban has received multiple coaching awards.\nIn the chaos of sport, as in life, process provides a way. A way to turn something very complex into something simple. Not that simple is easy.\nBut it is easier. Let\u2019s say you\u2019ve got to do something difficult. Don\u2019t focus on that. Instead break it down into pieces. Simply do what you need to do right now. And do it well. And then move on to the next thing. Follow the process and not the prize. As Bill Belichick famously put it, just do your job.\nThe road to back-to-back championships, or being a writer or a successful entrepreneur is just that, a road. And you travel along a road in steps. Excellence is a matter of steps. Excelling at this one, then that one and then the one after that. Saban\u2019s process is exclusively this\u2014existing in the present, taking it one step at a time, not getting distracted by anything else. Not the other team, not the scoreboard, or the crowd.\nThe process is about finishing. Finishing games. Finishing workouts. Finishing film sessions. Finishing drives. Finishing reps. Finishing plays. Finishing blocks. Finishing the smallest task you have right in front of you and finishing it well.\nWhether it\u2019s pursuing the pinnacle of success in your field, or simply surviving some awful or trying ordeal, the same approach works. Don\u2019t think about the end\u2014think about surviving. Getting it right from meal to meal, meeting to meeting, project to project, paycheck to paycheck, one day at a time.\nAnd when you really get it right, even the hardest things become manageable. As Heraclitus observed, \u201cunder the comb, the tangle and the straight path are the same.\u201d That\u2019s what the process is. Under its influence, we needn\u2019t panic. Even mammoth tasks become just a series of component parts.\nThis was what the great 19th-century pioneer of meteorology, James Pollard Espy, had shown to him in a chance encounter as a young man. Unable to read and write until he was 18, Espy attended a rousing speech by the famous orator Henry Clay. After the talk, a spellbound Espy tried to make his way toward Clay, but he couldn\u2019t form the words to speak to his idol. One of his friends shouted out for him: \u201cHe wants to be like you, even though he can\u2019t read.\u201d\nClay grabbed one of his posters, which had the word CLAY written in big letters. He looked at Espy and said, \u201cYou see that, boy?\u201d pointing to a letter. \u201cThat\u2019s an A. Now, you\u2019ve only got 25 more letters to go.\u201d\nEspy had just been gifted The Process. Within a year, he started college.\nWhat Rosen, what Espy, what these coaches are practicing is a central tenet of stoic philosophy\u2014one which I\u2019ve tried to pass along in The Obstacle is The Way. It\u2019s just a modern take on Marcus Aurelius when he advised:\n\u201cDon\u2019t let your imagination be crushed by life as a whole. Don\u2019t try to picture everything bad that could possibly happen. Stick with the situation at hand, and ask, \u201cWhy is this so unbearable? Why can\u2019t I endure it?\u201d\nStatue of the Roman emperor Marcus Aurelius (Photo: Getty Images)\nSeven seconds. Sticking to the situation at hand. Focusing on what\u2019s immediately in front of you. No strain, no struggling. So relaxed. No exertion or worry. Just one simple movement after another. That\u2019s the power of process.\nWe can channel this, too. We needn\u2019t scramble like we\u2019re so often inclined to do when some difficult task sits in front of us. Instead, we can take a breath, do the immediate, composite part in front of us\u2014and follow its thread into the next action. Everything in order, everything connected.\nWhen it comes to our actions, disorder and distraction are death. The unordered mind loses track of what\u2019s in front of it\u2014what matters\u2014and gets distracted by thoughts of the future. The process is order, it keeps our perceptions in check and our actions in sync.\nIt seems obvious, but we forget this when it matters most.\nRight now, if I knocked you down and pinned you to ground, how would you respond? You\u2019d probably panic. And then you\u2019d push with all your strength to get me off you. It wouldn\u2019t work; just using my body weight, I would be able to keep your shoulders against the ground with little effort\u2014and you\u2019d grow exhausted fighting it.\nThat\u2019s the opposite of the process.\nThe process is much easier. First, you don\u2019t panic, you conserve your energy. You don\u2019t do anything stupid like get yourself choked out by acting without thinking. You focus on not letting it get worse. Then you get your arms up, to brace and create some breathing room, some space. Now work to get on your side.  From there you can start to break down my hold on you: grab an arm, trap a leg, buck with your hips, slide in a knee.\nIt\u2019ll take some time, but you\u2019ll get yourself out. At each step, the person on top is forced to give a little up, until there\u2019s nothing left. Then you\u2019re free.\nBeing trapped is just a position, not a fate. You get out of it by addressing and eliminating each part of that position through small, deliberate action\u2014not by trying (and failing) to push it away with superhuman strength.\nWith our business rivals, we rack our brains to think of some mind-blowing new product that will make them irrelevant, and, in the process, we take our eye off the ball. We shy away from writing a book or making a film even though it\u2019s our dream because it\u2019s so much work\u2014we can\u2019t imagine how we get from here to there.\nHow often do we compromise or settle because we feel that the real solution is too ambitious or outside our grasp? How often do we assume that change is impossible because it\u2019s too big? Involves too many different groups? Or worse, how many people are paralyzed by all their ideas and inspirations? They chase them all and go nowhere, distracting themselves and never making headway. They\u2019re brilliant, sure, but they rarely execute. They rarely get where they want and need to go.\nAll these issues are solvable. Each would collapse beneath the process. We\u2019ve just wrongly assumed that it has to happen all at once, and we give up at the thought of it. We are A-to-Z thinkers, fretting about A, obsessing over Z, yet forgetting all about B through Y.\nWe want to have goals, yes, so everything we do can be in service of something purposeful. When we know what we\u2019re really setting out to do, the obstacles that arise tend to seem smaller, more manageable. When we don\u2019t, each one looms larger and seems impossible. Goals help put the blips and bumps in proper proportion.\nWhen we get distracted, when we start caring about something other than our own progress and efforts, the process is the helpful, if occasionally bossy, voice in our head. It is the bark of the wise, older leader who knows exactly who he is and what he\u2019s got to do. Shut up. Go back to your stations and try to think about what we are going to do ourselves, instead of worrying about what\u2019s going on out there. You know what your job is, stop jawing and get to work.\nThe process is the voice that demands we take responsibility and ownership. That prompts us to act even if only in a small way.\nLike a relentless machine, subjugating resistance each and every way it exists, little by little. Moving forward, one step at a time. Subordinate strength to the process. Replace fear with the process. Depend on it. Lean on it. Trust in it.\nTake your time, don\u2019t rush. Some problems are harder than others. Deal with the ones right in front of you first. Come back to the others later. You\u2019ll get there.\nThe process is about doing the right things, right now. Not worrying about what might happen later, or the results, or the whole picture.\nRyan Holiday is the best-selling author of The Obstacle Is the Way: The Timeless Art of Turning Trials into Triumph and two other books."}, {"author": "Ryan Holiday", "headline": "The Single Worst Marketing Decision You Can Make", "body": "Make something people want.\n\u2014Paul Graham\nYou know what the single worst marketing decision you can make is? Starting with a product nobody wants or nobody needs.\nYet for years, this was a scenario that marketers tolerated and accepted as part of the job. We all told ourselves that \u201cyou go to market with the product you have, not the one you want.\u201d And then we wondered why our strategies failed\u2014and why those failures were so expensive.\nWhat attracted me to growth hacking from the very start was that it rejects this obviously flawed approach outright. Growth hackers believe that products\u2014even whole businesses and business models\u2014can and should be changed until they are primed to generat explosive reactions from the first people who see them. In other words, the best marketing decision you can make is to have a product or business that fulfills a real and compelling need for a real and defined group of people\u2014no matter how much tweaking and refining this takes.\nTake Airbnb, a start-up now valued at some $10 billion. Today we know it as a site where, as cofounder Brian Chesky put it, \u201cyou can book space anywhere. It can be anything, and it really is anything from a tent to a castle.\u201d But in 2007, the business started as a way for the founders to turn the living room of their loft apartment into a little bed-and-breakfast. The founders named it airbedandbreakfast.com and put out air mattresses on their floor and offered free homemade breakfast to guests. But the founders wanted more.\nGoing back to the drawing board and hoping to capitalize on popular technology and design conferences, the founders repositioned the service as a networking alternative for attendees when hotels were booked up. This was clearly a better market, but the company sensed they could improve the idea further, so they pivoted slightly to target the type of traveler who didn\u2019t want to crash on couches or in hostels but was looking to avoid hotels. This did better still. Finally, based on feedback and usage patterns, they shortened the name to airbnb and abandoned the breakfast and networking parts of the business, redefining the service as a place for people to rent or book any kind of lodging imaginable (from rooms to apartments to trains, boats, castles, penthouses, and private islands). This was explosive\u2014to the tune of millions of bookings a year in locations all over the world.\nAirbnb had a good idea in 2007, but the actual value proposition, if we\u2019re being honest, was a little mediocre. The founders could have spent all their time and energy trying to force the \u201clet people crash on your floor and feed them breakfast\u201d angle and creating a small business around it. Instead, they treated their product and service as something malleable and were able to change and improve it until they found its best iteration. They went from a good but fairly impractical idea to an explosive and practical idea, and then as a result, a billion-dollar valuation. This switch was undoubtedly the best marketing decision they ever could have made.\nAs a traditional marketer, I can think of precisely zero times when we went back to the drawing board after seeing a less-than-stellar response. It wasn\u2019t permitted. Our only move was to put more muscle behind bad products and companies.\nIt was a wake-up call to me to learn that Airbnb was by no means unique: Instagram started as a location-based social network called Burbn (which had an optional photo feature). It attracted a core group of users and more than $500,000 in funding. And yet the founders realized that its users were flocking to only one part of the app\u2014the photos and filters. They had a meeting, which one of the founders recounts like this: \u201cWe sat down and said, \u2018What are we going to work on next? How are we going to evolve this product into something millions of people will want to use? What is the one thing that makes this product unique and interesting?\u2019\"\nThe service soon retooled to become Instagram as we know it: a mobile app for posting photos with filters. The result? One hundred thousand users within a week of relaunching. Within eighteen months, the founders sold Instagram to Facebook for $1 billion.\nI know that seems simple, that the marketing lesson from Instragram is that they made a product that was just awesome. But that\u2019s good news for you\u2014it means there\u2019s no secret sauce, and the second your product gets to be that awesome, you can see similar results. Just look at Snapchat, which essentially followed the same playbook by innovating in the mobile photo app space, blew up with young people, and skyrocketed to a $3.5-billion-dollar valuation with next-to-no marketing.\nSome companies like Airbnb and Instragram spend a long time trying new iterations until they achieve what growth hackers call Product Market Fit (PMF); others find it right away. The end goal is the same, however, and it\u2019s to have the product and its customers in perfect sync with each other. Eric Ries, author of The Lean Startup, explains that the best way to get to Product Market Fit is by starting with a \u201cminimum viable product\u201d and improving it based on feedback\u2014as opposed to what most of us do, which is to try to launch publicly with what we think is our final, perfected product.\nToday, it is the marketer\u2019s job as much as anyone else\u2019s to make sure Product Market Fit happens. Your marketing efforts are wasted on a mediocre product\u2014so don\u2019t tolerate mediocrity. OK?\nBut rather than waiting for it to happen magically or assuming that this is some other department\u2019s job, marketers need to contribute to this process. Isolating who your customers are, figuring out their needs, designing a product that will blow their minds\u2014these are marketing decisions, not just development and design choices.\nThe imperative is clear: stop sitting on your hands and start getting them dirty. Optimizing a product to spread and be well received by customers, by the media, and by influencers is something that you, as a marketer or a growth hacker, are uniquely qualified to do. You are, in effect, the translator who helps bridge the producers and the consumers so they are in alignment.\nAnd this is true whether you\u2019re making some physical gadget, designing a menu, or creating an app. Someone has to be the advocate for the potential market (customers), and the earlier their influence is felt in the process, the better.\nAmazon has actually made this part of their basic procedures. Ian McAllister, general manager at Amazon, calls this approach \u201cworking backwards from the customer.\u201d For new initiatives, employees begin by creating an internal press release that announces this new potential project as though it was just finished. It\u2019s addressed to the customers\u2014whoever they happen to be\u2014and explains how this new offering solves their problems in an exciting or compelling way.\nIf the press release cannot do that, the initiative is tweaked and tweaked and tweaked until it can, according to McAllister, Amazon encourages product managers to think like Oprah\u2014that is, would she rapturously shout about this product if she were giving it away to her fans as a gift?\nThe exercise forces the team to focus on exactly what its potential new product is and what\u2019s special about it. I guarantee that someone with a mind that bends toward growth hacking put this policy into place.\nNo longer content to let the development happen as it happens, we can influence it with input, with rules and guidelines, and with feedback. The growth hacker helps with iterations, advises, and analyzes every facet of the business. In other words, Product Market Fit is a feeling backed with data and information.\nHow Do You Get PMF?\nBecause Product Market Fit can be overwhelming as a technical business concept, allow me to explain it by dropping the jargon and presenting an analogy. As it turns out, I was familiar with PMF long before I read Andrew Chen\u2019s article.\nMuch of the marketing I do is with authors and books. I\u2019ve worked with dozens of bestsellers in the last five years\u2014and, of course, I\u2019ve also worked on many books that weren\u2019t successful. In my experience, the books that tend to flop upon release are those where the author goes into a cave for a year to write it, then hands it off to the publisher for release. They hope for a hit that rarely comes.\nOn the other hand, I have clients who blog extensively before publishing. They develop their book ideas based on the themes that they naturally gravitate toward but that also get the greatest response from readers. (One client sold a book proposal using a screenshot of Google queries to his site.) They test the ideas they\u2019re writing about in the book on their blog and when they speak in front of groups. They ask readers what they\u2019d like to see in the book. They judge topic ideas by how many comments a given post generates, by how many Facebook \u201cshares\u201d an article gets. They put potential title and cover ideas up online to test and receive feedback. They look to see what hot topics other influential bloggers are riding and find ways of addressing them in their book.*\nThe latter achieves PMF; the former never does. One is growth hacking; the other, simply guessing.\nOne is easy for me to market. The other is often a lost cause. One needs only a small shove to get going. The other has a strong headwind every step of the way.\nAmazon, for its part, has a couple of other easy suggestions for you if the advice \u201cwrite a hypothetical press release\u201d doesn\u2019t quite work for your situation. Their CTO, Werner Vogels, suggests trying to write an FAQ for this product you\u2019re developing. (That way you can address, in advance, potential user issues and questions.) Or try to define the crucial parts of the user experience by making mockups of pages, writing hypothetical case studies so you can actually start to see what it would look like and who it would work for and how. Finally, try writing the user manual, which as Werner explains usually has three parts: concepts, how-to, and reference. (Defining these means you understand your idea in and out from the customers perspective. Also, he says, if you have more than one type of user then write multiple manuals.)\nI love those ideas. They might feel like homework, but they force you to imagine your product from someone\u2019s perspective other than your own. That\u2019s the best way to get to PMF\u2014because ultimately this isn\u2019t about you; it\u2019s about the people you\u2019re trying to turn into customers.\nPerhaps you\u2019ll get to PMF with one aha moment like Instagram, or it may be incremental percent improvements. As Marc Andreessen\u2014the entrepreneur behind Netscape, Opsware, and Ning who, in addition to running a major venture capital fund, happens to be on the board of directors for Facebook, eBay, and HP\u2014explains it, companies need to \u201cdo whatever is required to get to product/market fit. Including changing out people, rewriting your product, moving into a different market, telling customers no when you don\u2019t want to, telling customers yes when you don\u2019t want to, raising that fourth round of highly dilutive venture capital\u2014whatever is required.\u201d\nIn other words: everything is now on the table.\nOpen Up to Feedback\nPart of this new approach is having the humility to accept that marketers are not necessarily the most critical members of the team. It\u2019s true. Sometimes the best thing marketers can do is to not let people get distracted by \u201cmarketing\u201d for a minute. Sometimes the outward-facing part of the job is exactly the least important part.\nTake Evernote, a start-up that offers productivity and organization software, which made the companywide decision to delay spending even a penny on marketing for the first several years of its growth. As Evernote\u2019s founder, Phil libin, told a group of entrepreneurs in a now-classic talk, \u201cPeople [who are] thinking about things other than making the best product, never make the best product.\u201d So Evernote took \u201cmarketing\u201d off the table and instead poured that budget into product development. This undoubtedly slowed brand building at first\u2014but it paid off. Why? Because Evernote is far and away the most superior productivity and note-taking application on the planet. Today, it practically markets itself.\nPerhaps this is what you need to do. I know you\u2019re probably reading this book looking for some immediate tips you can put into action\u2014places you can deploy your budget or resources. But let\u2019s think outside the box\u2014 outside the budget\u2014and consider whether improving your product might be the best strategy.\nThat\u2019s not to say you shouldn\u2019t do anything at all. Evernote still came up with a bunch of clever tricks to get people to see its products while marketing was on their strategic back burner. After hearing customers complain that their bosses were suspicious of employees using their laptops in meetings, the Evernote team produced stickers that said, \u201cI\u2019m not being rude. I\u2019m taking notes in Evernote.\u201d Thus, their most loyal customers were turning into billboards that went from meeting to meeting.\nOnce we stop thinking of the products we market as static\u2014that our job as marketers is to simply work with what we\u2019ve got instead of working on and improving what we\u2019ve got\u2014the whole game changes. Now we are not helpless, repeatedly pitching a product to reporters and users that is not resonating. Instead, we use this information to improve the product, with the idea of ultimately refining our idea into something that can in many ways sell itself.\nThe race has changed. The prize and spoils no longer go to the person who makes it to market first. They go to the person who makes it to Product Market Fit first. Because once you get there, your marketing efforts become like a spark applied to a bed of kindling soaked in kerosene. The old way? It\u2019s striking a match...and hoping it starts a fire somewhere.\nThe point is: marketing as we know it is a waste of time without PMF.\nOf course, there are many tools to help get you there. From Google to Optimizely to KISSmetrics, there are great services that allow you to see what your users are actually doing and responding to on your site. This insight will get you closer to a fit than gut instincts ever will.\nBut the most effective method is simply the Socratic method. We must simply and repeatedly question every assumption. Who is this product for? Why would they use it? Why do I use it?\nask your customers questions, too: What is it that brought you to this product? What is holding you back from referring other people to it? What\u2019s missing? What\u2019s golden? Don\u2019t ask random people or your friends\u2014be scientific about it. Use tools like Surveymonkey, Wufoo, Qualaroo, or even Google Docs, which make it very easy to offer surveys to some or all of your customers.\nFor the first time we can ask these questions because we intend to do something about it. No more privately complaining to friends, coworkers, and spouses that we\u2019re stuck with a product nobody wants.\nNot to say that you must use all the data that comes back, but you should have it. The black-box approach is no longer necessary. Change is possible\u2014which means you need to make yourself available and open to it.\nProduct Market Fit is not some mythical status that happens accidentally. Companies work for it; they crawl toward it. They\u2019re ready to throw out weeks or months of\nN work because the evidence supports that decision. The services as their customers know them now are fundamentally different from what they were at launch\u2014before they had Product Market Fit.\nBut once these companies get PMF, they don\u2019t just wait and hope that success will come along on its own. The next step is to bring the customers in.\nRyan Holiday is a media strategist and prominent writer on strategy and business.

Paradoxically, given the nature of its work, this is an area where one would assume that the most compassion in any society should be found. It does not add up. We need to reset our health and care services so they are fit for the 21st century.\nEveryone in Nigeria used to respect doctors and nurses. And why not? These are jobs that are as demanding as they are vital. Healthcare workers were seen as arbiters of life and death, a duty that was held sacred. But the endless cycle of strikes seem to be eroding much of this. While doctors, nurses, and other healthcare workers often have a genuine dissatisfaction with the facilities where they work, accessibility to drugs, and general conditions of service, the core issue at the heart of these strikes has been remuneration and status.\nPerhaps, it is time to expand this conversation beyond healthcare workers and government. Leaving it to healthcare workers and government in the past has only led to \u201ccollective bargaining agreements\u201d (CBAs) for improved wages and conditions of service that have been unsustainable. Government accedes to these collective agreements in the heat of each strike, and it quickly becomes obvious that it cannot fund the agreements, especially when other professions start agitating as well, and then we are back to square one, and a new cycle begins.\nAt the moment, there appears to be only one inevitable trajectory to the situation with strikes; more strikes, which lead to more disruption, which leads to more risks to the professional reputations of doctors and nurses, leading to more loss of public patience, and ultimately, this will inevitably lead to the failure of the public sector healthcare delivery system. Without radical reforms, it is hard to see how the current management arrangement of tertiary hospitals in Nigeria will survive. Just like NEPA and NITEL, we have started our descent.\nWe do not realise the damage done by strikes in our context because no one bothers to count. When junior doctors working in the UK\u2019s National Health Service (NHS) went on strike for two days recently, the first time this was happening in its history, it led to the cancellation of 125,000 operations and appointments. In Nigeria, strikes continue for months, with associated loss of life and income. If we counted the damage done by strikes in Nigeria, there would be widespread outrage.\nPicture credit: Orodata\nThe time has come to have a deeper conversation on the impact of strikes by health care workers on the lives of Nigerians. Nigerians can no longer afford to leave this to the professionals and the government to resolve. The Government is there to represent us, by allocating our common resources to pay health workers to provide care for us. It is time for us to raise our voices and assess how both our government and the healthcare workers employed on our behalf are fulfilling their responsibilities to us.\nIn order to achieve success, and stop this alarming descent, we must urgently commence an Indaba, a conversation process, whose recommendations must lead to implementation, and not be shelved like the many previous ones. We must find some eminent and credible Nigerians to lead this conversation. It will have to be led by someone outside of the key medical professions because of the loss of trust among health sector professionals.  During this Indaba, we must address some of the most fundamental issues facing the sector, which we have chosen to overlook over the years. There are five critical points that we think must be addressed:\nIntroduce accountability into patient-care - There must be a relationship between salaries in public sector hospitals and outcomes. Outcomes have to include both process outcomes, such as numbers of patients seen, clinical outcomes, as well as patient satisfaction. As long as there is no form of accountability in the sector, the only source of motivation to work is healthcare workers\u2019 altruism, which unfortunately is not sufficient in our context.\nUnderstand the appropriate doctor/nurse to patient ratio appropriate for each department in our tertiary hospitals - The situation at the moment where a single tertiary hospital has upwards of 20 consultants in a single department, and a handful in other departments, unrelated to activity, is simply unsustainable. Over the past few years, the government has continued hiring staff without any analysis of need or any understanding of workload. It is no surprise that they end up being unable to pay.\nDe-centralise salaries - Every tertiary hospital in Nigeria currently arranges its own procurement of everything from paracetamol to equipment. There is absolutely no point anymore for a uniform salary structure from Port Harcourt to Potiskum, from Abeokuta to Damaturu, when the circumstances, cost of living, work load and almost every criteria to determine pay is radically different across Nigeria. Trying to sustain a uniform pay band across Nigeria might provide for equality but definitely not equity.\nMake every tertiary hospital in Nigeria publish its accounts - In tertiary hospitals, the \u201cChief Medical Directors\u201d are Chief Executives with un-paralleled powers. Every decision begins and ends with them. Other than the annual publication of budgets, no one knows how much money they get from the Federal Government, from the National Health Insurance Scheme, from fee-paying patients or how much they are spending. Let Nigerians know how much of their money is going to salaries, medicines, equipment, etc.\nImplement that National Health Act \u2013 The new National Health Act provides for the establishment of a National Tertiary Health Institutions Standard Committee that would regulate tertiary health facilities, providing guidelines for the use of Tertiary Hospital Management Boards. If this is implemented, and hospitals held publicly accountable to its implementation, this will make the consequences of strikes much more immediate for each hospital.\nWe have always held the opinion at Nigeria Health Watch that strikes should be an extreme last option for healthcare workers.  A strike means walking out on our patients, leaving them in the ICUs and emergency rooms. We recognise the challenges that many Nigerian healthcare workers face, trying to deliver care in a context where many of the basic functions of society are broken or non-existent; and the responsibility of the employer to the employed. But we also believe that a person choosing healthcare as a profession must examine their motivation and understand the choices that they make.\nIt is time for this conversation to happen, or else our descent will continue, and it may just reach the point\u2026 of no-return."}, {"author": "Chikwe Ihekweazu", "headline": "On World Tuberculosis Day - Reflections on a Forgotten Epidemic", "body": "March 24 was World TB Day, yet for most people that have the privilege of reading this piece, tuberculosis is an abstract term.\nWhy would a disease that infects about half a million Nigerians every year, and kills about 170,000 annually attract so little attention from the government, the health professions and from the people? The answer is simple \u2013 it is a disease that disproportionately affects the poor and marginalised. It is widely recognised that the poorer the community, the greater the likelihood of being infected with the TB germ and developing clinical disease. A lack of basic health services, poor nutrition, inadequate living conditions and HIV all contribute to the spread of TB. With poor access to health services to diagnose or treat patients, there is a longer delay between disease and treatment, perpetuating the spread of TB. In a hyper-capitalist society like Nigeria, it is not hard to see why patients with tuberculosis fall through the cracks.\nThe first challenge in Nigeria, as with many other things, is to understand the size of the problem. Over the past four years, about 100,000 cases of all forms of TB were diagnosed in health centres across the country. However, in 2012/13, the National Tuberculosis and Leprosy Control Programme (NTLCP), under the leadership of Dr. Olusegun Obasanya at the time, conducted the first ever population based national prevalence survey, which revealed some shocking results.\nThe estimated overall prevalence was double what was being counted and the incidence (rate of new cases) a year was three times previous estimates. Assuming a resident population of 170 million in Nigeria, the estimated number of new cases of all forms of TB would be about 570,000, revealing a huge gap in case detection. This showed that Nigeria\u2019s case detection rate for all forms of TB currently stood at only 15 percent, one of the lowest case detection rates in the world.\nFor the cases that are detected, they are almost exclusively managed in the public sector, and the management of TB has been generally limited to \"Directly Observed Treatment Short course\" (or \u201cDOTS\u201d) centres and \u201cChest Clinics\u201d, a practice that belongs in the dark ages. Contemporary science suggests that there is no medical or public health reason why patients with TB should be diagnosed and managed in any out-patient setting separate from any other patient. Mycobacterium tuberculosis is such a poorly virulent organism that the risk of transmission in an outpatient clinic in our context is minimal. This practice has led to a whole generation of doctors who have little experience in how to manage patients with TB, because all they do is refer to \"DOTS\" centres. It is time to change this and normalise TB treatment, by bringing it back into primary health centres in Nigeria. The national TB strategic plan (2015 \u2013 2020) suggests an expansion of DOTS services to more facilities across the country in order to improve case notification rates. We suggest going a step further: make every public healthcare facility in Nigeria a \u201cDOTS Centre\u201d. Every functional public health care facility should have the capacity and resources to manage patients with TB.\nHowever, to get TB cases into care, they need to be diagnosed. This is being addressed to some extent by the roll of out of the Xpert MTB/RIF assay (carried out in \u201cGeneXpert machines\u201d) in Nigeria. The Xpert MTB/RIF assay is a new test that is changing tuberculosis (TB) diagnosis by enabling the rapid diagnosis of TB disease and drug resistance. The test simultaneously detects Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex (MTBC) and resistance to rifampin (RIF) in less than 2 hours. In comparison, standard cultures can take 2 to 6 weeks for MTBC to grow and conventional drug resistance tests can add 3 more weeks. Up to the end of 2015,there are just over 200 centres with GeneXpert machines in Nigeria. The policy has recently been changed to allow the use of Xpert MTB/RIF assay for the diagnoses of all potential TB cases without restrictions, where the test is available. The GeneXpert equipment is however very expensive, and these costs go way beyond the initial costs. This paper by Abdurrahman et al showed that the \u201chidden\u201d costs of installing these machines could be up to 3 times the cost of the machines themselves. In addition, because these rely heavily on constant electricity to work, their utility is limited to centres where this is available. Of the 200 centres in Nigeria, most are in the public sector, with 22 being in the private sector; predominantly faith-based not-for-profit hospitals. This March, the NTBLCP in collaboration with USAID conducted an assessment of the TB laboratory diagnostic capacity in Nigeria, including laboratory infrastructure, technology and human resources. The results from this will further guide the efforts to increase case detection in Nigeria.\nNigeria has the fourth highest annual number of TB cases in the world. We cannot get on top of this by passive detection of TB as is currently the case. Studies such as this one by Oshi et al shows that intensified case finding combined with capacity building, provision of work guidelines, and TB health education can improve TB notification.\nFor World TB Day 2016, WHO calls on governments, communities, civil society, and the private sector to \"Unite to End TB\". WHO and partners are promoting dialogue and collaboration that unites individuals and communities in new ways to end the tuberculosis (TB) epidemic. These efforts cut across disciplines and sectors, and can help accelerate progress towards the Sustainable Development Goals overall by contributing to other areas including poverty elimination, universal health coverage, maternal and child health, social protection and justice. The World Health Organizations\u2019s End TB Strategy envisions a world free of TB with zero deaths, disease and suffering. It sets targets and outlines actions for governments and partners to provide patient-centred care, pursue policies and systems that enable prevention and care, and drive research and innovations needed to end the epidemic and eliminate TB.\nEvery country is judged by how it treats its most vulnerable. Maybe it's time for us to stand up for ours. We can #EndTB, but we must reach the most vulnerable!\nWatch this short documentary on Drug resistant Tuberculosis on the rise in Nigeria."}, {"author": "Chikwe Ihekweazu", "headline": "Lack of trust in health sector: the underlying cause of the large Lassa Fever outbreak in Nigeria", "body": "Strange deaths in a community in Niger State in 2015 left the community confused, this was followed by a period of uncertainty and anxiety, and they reached out to the only rational explanation they could imagine \u2013 the supernatural. By the time the public health authorities were informed and a diagnosis of Lassa Fever was made, the outbreak had spread to many states. Control efforts included a mixture of persuasion to report suspicious cases to health authorities, establishment of task teams, and even an emergency meeting of the National Council of Health. One patient is reported to have \u201cescaped\u201d the hospital where he was being treated. The community was scared; they did not know who to trust.\nThe Nigerian Centre for Disease Control is evolving and Prof. Abdulsalami Nasidi has promised that its new Reference Laboratory in Kaduwa, Abuja will be ready for commissioning soon. On a morning television broadcast on the Nigerian Television Authority on the 20th of January he praised the efforts of the seven diagnostic centres in the country and promised to redouble control efforts. Colleagues in the Nigerian Field Epidemiology Training Programme are supporting the response.  As an epidemiologist myself, there is little that will make me prouder than a vibrant, professional Centre for Disease Control in Nigeria.\nHowever, the reality of this Lassa Fever outbreak, and all outbreaks that I have worked on in my many years as an infectious diseases epidemiologist have taught me that while epidemiology and diagnostic capacity are important components of health security, the most important line of defense may not be improved technology or quicker response times by my colleagues \u2013 epidemiologists, virologists, clinicians or surveillance officers.\nThe single most important factor in the control of outbreaks is trust in the health care system by the citizens of a country. A great \u201cCentre for Disease Control\u201d, is worth very little in the context of a public health care system that is largely dysfunctional, which its citizens do not trust.\nA lack of trust would not have prevented a few cases of Ebola emerging, but it was at the centre of the exponential spread of the Ebola outbreak in Liberia, Guinea and Sierra Leone, and at the heart of the challenges we faced during the response that I participated in, on the ground in Liberia. The need to focus on building trust in communities, and with their health care system is the most important lesson that I learnt from the response to the Ebola outbreak. A lack of trust in the public health care system is the most important reason the current Lassa Fever outbreak continues to spread.\nThe most likely transmission mechanism for the current Lassa Fever outbreak is person-to-person transmission. While rats are the likely source of initial infection, it is extremely unlikely, given the geographical distribution of cases that there is any on-going zoonotic source of infection. Therefore, to break the chains of transmission of the Lassa Fever virus, people must trust the health authorities enough to inform them of any signs of illness and not seek alternative sources of relief. Those infected and affected must trust that the healthcare workers\u2019 that they report to will treat them and care for them humanely in the presence of overwhelming historical evidence to the contrary.\nWhen a potential Lassa Fever patient declines to go into a primary health centre or hospital for care, this is often described as \u201cirrational\u201d and \u201cillogical\u201d behavior. Yet in the past the same healthcare workers have often failed to care for his child who had severe malaria, or failed to prevent the death of a sister following child birth? How could he be expected to suddenly trust the same health care worker that was never in his/her clinic all these years when he needed them?\nWhen this outbreak is over, the most likely scenario in Nigeria will be the re-start of the celebratory mode of the post Ebola period, rather than a period of introspection and retrospection. We will make speeches and pat ourselves on the back. However, this \u2018outbreak narrative\u2019 fails to capture the complexity of the underlying factor, trust, which I believe is largely responsible for the rapid spread and failure of initial control attempts of this outbreak. If we continue business as usual, we must expect the next outbreak pretty soon.\nThe most important line of defense for us in Nigeria is to rebuild our confidence in the capacity of our government to prioritize the health to its citizens.  This will require a complete turnaround in our health systems\u2019 capacity to respond to the \u201croutine\u201d health needs of a population. It is only by responding to these in \u201cpeacetime\u201d and building trust, will we have the capacity to respond better to the next crisis. Trust in our health systems will not prevent outbreaks (outbreaks of infectious diseases will always be with us), but it would most likely have prevented large outbreaks like the Lassa Fever one that we are experiencing. To do this, we need the Nigerian government to earn the confidence of its citizens in their ability to serve their interests and protect them.\nAs an infectious disease epidemiologist, my career has been built around measuring infectious disease burdens, determining trends, assessing risk factors and measuring the impact of control measures; this is my comfort zone. But I have learned that not everything that can be measured matters \u2013 and not everything that matters can be measured.\nTrust exemplifies this. When a society loses confidence in those to whom they would normally turn to in times of need, they resort to actions that can be generally considered \u201cirrational\u201d and illogical\u201d and unwittingly spread the disease further. Recognising this limitation has changed the way I view the relevance of my profession in the context of outbreak control. Learning from and applying this knowledge will be the most critical challenge of the post Lassa Fever outbreak period.\nNigerians, want their existing primary health centres to work. Only when trust is restored in the capabilities and compassion of the public health system can we hope to prevent large outbreaks from occurring. Restoring trust in existing primary health centres is much more important today than building 10,000 new ones."}, {"author": "Chikwe Ihekweazu", "headline": "Before the SDGs, how did Nigeria really do with the MDGS?", "body": "  By Chikwe Ihekweazu\nNigeria Health Watch\n\nIn August 2015, reports emerged in the Nigerian press that \u201cNigeria had attained the Millennium Development Goals\u201d.  The article above the Secretary of Programmes in the Office of the Senior Special Assistant to the President on MDGs, Mr. Ogenyi Ochapa, verbatim, with no critical commentary on the validity of his statement, which boldly declared: Nigeria has Attained HIV, Maternal Mortality MDGs ahead of Deadline!\nLate in September 2015, almost everyone in the Nigerian health establishment was in New York for the UN General Assembly (UNGA). It was at a side event of the UNGA, at the United Nations headquarters, that the country\u2019s final status report on the implementation of the Millennium Development Goals was released. We have tried to find out if there was a subsequent event in Nigeria to share this report with the Nigerian people, to no avail.\nOther than a few reports on the meeting in September, there has been almost no reportage on the report, or its outcomes. The entire development community has moved on to the new Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).One reason for this may be that the report itself is almost impossible to find. This most important report that describes the outcomes of a project that Nigeria and all supporting development partners invested billions of Naira is not on the website of the \u201cOffice of the Special Assistant to the President on MDGs\u201d as at the last time we accessed it, which was today, 10/11/15.\nBut it is important that we know if the \u201cGoals\u201d were achieved and what the outcomes of our investments were. So, we got hold of the MDGs End-Point Report and encourage you to read it.\nFirst, let\u2019s remind ourselves on what the Millennium Development Goals were meant to be. In 2000, at the United Nations Millennium Summit, 189 world leaders, including Nigeria\u2019s, adopted the Millennium Declaration to overcome poverty through a set of eight mutually reinforcing interrelated time-bound goals (MDGs) with related targets. One of the stated objectives of the \u201cGoals\u201d was to provide an \u201caccountability framework\u201d. The attractiveness of having goals is that simple statements can be made and communicated on if they were achieved or not. The MDGs were at the forefront of the global development agenda to eradicate poverty by 2015.\nIn Nigeria, as we do, in 2005 we created the Office of the Senior Special Assistant to the President on the Millennium Development Goals with Directors, Officers and a huge budget to provide guidance, coordination and oversight on the attainment of the MDGs.\nThere are eight goals, but for the purposes of our platform, lets examine how Nigeria did, from the report of the Office of the Senior Special Assistant, on the 3 health-related goals and associated targets; Goals 4, 5 and 6.\nGoal 4: Reduce Child Mortality \u2013 Target: Reduce by two-thirds, between 1990 and 2015, the under-five mortality rate. None of the indicators for this target; under-five mortality rate, infant mortality rate and the proportion of one year-old children immunized against measles were met in Nigeria.\nGoal 5: Improve Maternal Health \u2013 Target: Reduce by three-quarters, between 1990 and 2015, the maternal mortality ratio. The first indicator is on maternal mortality ratio, which the report says that Nigeria has met \u2013 from a baseline figure of 1000 deaths per 100,000 live births in 1990 to its end-point status of 243 per 100,000 live births in 2014.\nHowever this is contradicted by data from the Demographic and Health Survey done in Nigeria in 2013 and carried out by the National Population Commission and partners, which reported that the maternal mortality ratio in 2013 was 576 deaths per 100,000 births, an insignificant difference from the 2008 finding of 545 deaths per 100,000 births.\nDraw your own conclusions. None of the other indicators; proportion of births attended by skilled health personnel, unmet need for family planning, and antenatal care coverage were met.\nGoal 6: Combat HIV and AIDS, malaria and other diseases \u2013 Target: Have halted, by 2015, and begun to reverse the spread of HIV and AIDS. None of the nine indicators relating to HIV, TB and Malaria were met and on TB specifically, incident rates are actually increasing.\nIn summary, of the 16 indicators relating to three Millennium Development Goals relating to health, 15 were not met and only one was met. The one that was met, relating to maternal mortality is contradicted by data from a report considered to be the industry standard for that indicator, also commissioned by the same government.\nGranted, the MDGs were ambitious, and granted there has been some progress on many of the indicators, but there is really nothing to celebrate considering the funds invested by the Nigerian Government and development partners on behalf of the Nigerian people.\nBefore going full steam into committing funds to the new Sustainable Development Goals, it would be prudent to do a critical review on the approach taken by Nigeria. This is especially important as the government reaches conclusions on whether setting up a mini-parastatal as in the \u201cOffice of the Senior Special Assistant to the President on the Millennium Development Goals\u201d that was constructing buildings and boreholes across the country was the right approach rather than investing in the public institutions with a mandate to carry out these functions.\nWith a new government in place in Nigeria, just at the time the new SDGs have been agreed, there is no better time to ask these questions."}, {"author": "Chikwe Ihekweazu", "headline": "One year later, 5 most important lessons from the Nigerian Ebola Response ", "body": "By Chikwe Ihekweazu\nNigeria Health Watch\nOn October 20 2014, almost exactly one year ago, the World Health Organisation declared Nigeria Ebola free, 42 days after the last known case had occurred. At the time the world was in the grip of one of the largest and most terrifying public health disasters in generations.\nWhile not completely over, there are signs that we are finally getting to the end of this outbreak which has had an unprecedented impact on the sub-continent. The Ebola outbreak claimed thousands of people, including hundreds of doctors and health care workers and it will be a tragedy of immense proportions if lessons are not learnt and history repeats itself. While we wait for our governments and schools of public health to engage with this process, we offer a starting point of the reflection that should be happening across the country and continent.\nCompared to the three most affected countries, Nigeria had a relatively small outbreak. As the outbreak escalated in Liberia, Guinea and Sierra Leone, there was significant anxiety on the consequences of the introduction of the virus to Lagos, with its estimated population of 15 million, living in densely populated neighbourhoods. In many ways Nigeria was lucky that its first case entered the country through the main airport and presented to one of the most recognised private hospitals in Lagos. Here, the astute clinical acumen and professionalism of the staff of First Consultants Hospital Group led to the rapid diagnosis of Ebola and the sheer determination of its excellent group of clinicians prevented the patient from leaving the hospital at his request, most probably saving the country from many more infections. This was done at great personal sacrifice, with many of the team paying the ultimate price with their lives.\nSubsequently, the country experienced probably its finest hours in public health by rapidly mobilising the resources to mount a determined response. The rest is history, as the country managed to limit the number of cases to 19 with 10 deaths, confounding the predictions of doom that had spread around the world. Nigeria saved itself not only from a major public health crisis but also an economic one, as the consequences of exclusion from the global economy would have been a disastrous outcome for the country.\nOne year after the outbreak, it is important for the country to reflect both on what was achieved and how it was achieved, but most importantly we must ponder whether  the lessons learnt have formed the basis for the prevention of future outbreaks and the preparation of a more robust response in the future. We hope that the Federal Ministry of Health and its National Centre for Disease Control has carried out a similar exercise, or if not, that this piece inspires them to do so. We propose these five areas below as those that enabled the successful response in Nigeria and therefore should be further developed.\nCentral coordination through an \u201cEmergency Operations Centre\u201d (EOC)\nNigeria\u2019s rapid response to the introduction of Ebola benefited from having an established EOC that was funded and set up by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation to support the response towards the elimination of polio in Nigeria. The deputy incident manager of the polio EOC was rapidly deployed to lead theEbola EOC (watch a great interview with Dr Faisal Shuaib by Ebola Deeply). Nigerian authorities moved quickly to establish a co-ordinated response using EOC structures previously developed for its polio response and drew from its experience in setting up strict command and control structures to manage the response.\nAmong its activities, the team coordinated the follow up of thousands of contacts, developed a staffing plan that executed a social mobilization strategy that reached more than 26,000 households of people living around the contacts of Ebola patients, and ensured that resources required for the clinical management of cases were available. A number of partners from WHO, CDC, UNICEF and MSF were part of the EOC structure, however all reporting and communication was done through the incident manager appointed by the Ministry of Health for this purpose.  After the Ebola response using EOCs in Lagos and Port Harcourt, its core structure was moved to Abuja to maintain contingency arrangements. This has since faded away quietly. It is not clear what proactive steps the country is taking to sustain an operational EOC, nor where this would be located.\nThe public health function of the private hospitals\nIt is difficult to overstate the critical role that a culture of strong clinical governance and an awareness of public health responsibility played in shaping the response of the First Consultants Hospital Group in Lagos to the Ebola outbreak, led by Dr Adadevoh and her team . Population health as proposed by Kindig et al is a concept of health that focuses on \u201cthe health outcomes of a group of individuals, including the distribution of such outcomes within the group,\u201d and includes health outcomes, patterns of health determinants, and policies and interventions that link these two. Population health is primarily a goal\u2014a goal of achieving measurable improvements in the health of a defined population. Therefore it is important not only for those responsible for the health of populations, but for all those working in hospitals and clinics with a responsibility to deliver care to understand concepts such as prevalence, incidence, risk, and disease determinants at a population level in order to practise to a high level. If Dr Adadevoh and her team were not acutely knowledgeable on this, Nigeria would have ended up with a completely different outbreak. Dr. Ada Ighonoh, a young doctor at the hospital who survived Ebola, gave a personal account of how she survived and how she is using her second chance at life to prepare herself to prevent similar incidents from happening in the future. Every doctor should listen, and learn.\nCommunication matters more than ever during outbreaks\nDuring the outbreak, the media was saturated with messages on Ebola. It was on every media, on television, radio, on newspapers on social media. Suddenly there were Ebola experts everywhere and people were rapidly educated on the risks of the disease, the symptoms and what to do if one had symptoms. But this was not the case in the beginning of the outbreak, when stories on remedies such as \u201csalt water\u201d, \u201cbitter kola\u201d and \u201cNano Silver\u201d filled the airwaves as we clutched at straws, filled with anxiety. A completely volunteer group, EbolaAlert led by Dr Lawal Bakare rose out of Nigeria to be one of the most credible sources of information on Ebola. Led by young Nigerians, they quickly garnered over sixty thousand followers on twitter. At this time, there was virtually no usable information on the website of the Federal Ministry of Health and the Nigerian Centre for Disease Control did not and still does not have a website through which it can inform the population. The impact of poor communication was demonstrated acutely during the recent apparent Ebola\u201cscare\u201d in Calabar.\nInvesting in training and development: The National Field Epidemiology Training Programme example.\nA few years ago, with the support of the US CDC, the Field Epidemiology and Laboratory Training Program (FELTP) was set up in Nigeria.  This is a two-year competency-based training and service program in applied epidemiology and public health that builds the capacity to strengthen the surveillance and response systems of a country. It is managed by the Federal Ministry of Health, the Federal Ministry of Agriculture, in partnership with the University of Ibadan and Ahmadu Bello University in Zaria. The programme trains medical epidemiology residents, public health laboratory residents, and veterinary epidemiology residents for leadership positions. The field epidemiology component is similar to programs that have been established in more than 30 countries. Itis modeled after the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\u2019s (CDC) two-year Epidemic Intelligence Service (EIS) training program and is composed of 25% course work and 75% field work. Current and past fellows of the programme who were already trained in most of the requisite skills formed the bedrock of the contact tracing and case investigation teams during the Nigerian response. Having this cohort of experts readily available is a testament to the importance of investing in developing skills for the future.\n      5. Leadership\nThe leadership provided by the then Minister of Health, Professor Onyebuchi Chukwu, the then Governor of Lagos State, Babatunde Fashola, SAN, and his Commissioner for Health, Dr. Jide Idris were critical in controlling the outbreak. Despite some initial disagreements in approach, they maintained a collaborative framework in agreeing strategy and communication, recognising the lead responsibility of the Federal Government during major outbreak situations. They worked together to prevent the doomsday scenario of the rapid spread of the disease predicted in Nigeria. The function of leadership is not however limited to the public sector leaders but across the entire chain of command to the so-called \u201cboots on the ground\u201d that went house to house diligently following up on all the contacts.\nIronically, at the time of the outbreak, doctors working in public hospitals across Nigeria were on strike. This probably represents the biggest area of public sector leadership failure  in the health sector over the last decade.\nThere are definitely many other lessons that the outbreak has taught us, here we have offered our top five. Evaluations are only consequential if their results lead to change and improvement. There has been a lot of chest beating on the successful Nigerian response, now it is time to prepare for the future."}, {"author": "Chikwe Ihekweazu", "headline": "Three reasons Strikes will continue in Nigeria\u2019s Health Sector", "body": "No part of public service in Nigeria has experienced more strikes than the health sector.\nRight now, public tertiary hospitals in Nigeria are struggling to get back to life after another series of strikes. The University College Hospital, Ibadan, was crippled for 108 days by a strike called by the Association of Resident Doctors. At LAUTECH Oshogbo, a strike closed the hospital for 5 months, and in the Psychiatric Hospital in Yaba, doctors walked away from their duty posts leaving their patients to their own means.  The story of the Federal Medical Centre in Owerri is already legendary, as health workers came to \u201cwork\u201d every day but spent their time singing and praying on the hospital grounds, while ignoring their patients in the wards, protesting against the privatisation of some of the hospitals services. Their strike lasted for three months.\nThis story map details the major health sector strikes in 2015.\nLast year, many public sector hospitals across the country were closed for about half of the year following strikes as doctors refused to return to work, even during the Ebola outbreak. Almost as soon as they returned, other health sector workers under the aegis of the Joint Health Sector Unions (JOHESU) proceeded to strike from November 2014 to February 2015.\nWhen there are strikes in public sector hospitals, there are only two constituencies that suffer: a) the patients, and b) the tax-payer (i.e. you and I), who do not get a service that is paid for on our behalf by government. Other health workers not on strike all collect their full salaries and allowances, the health workers on strike are ultimately paid in most cases, and even the hospital still gets its normal allocation from the Federal Ministry of Health as well as its quarterly \u201callocation\u201d from the National Health Insurance Scheme, whether any of its\u2019 patients covered by the scheme received clinical care during that quarter or not. So, for health workers and hospitals there are few, if any, consequences from strikes.\nAs professional bodies in the health sector prepare for strike actions, they tend to make three assumptions which make the decision so easy in Nigeria. Below we examine these assumptions and highlight how they may not continue to hold in the future:\nGovernment will always settle, eventually: Let\u2019s tell ourselves the simple truth. Government has always settled. Not only have they always settled, they have not asked or received anything tangible in return.  Salaries have increased without any change to the quality of service delivered. The complexity of health and measuring impact makes accountability difficult. So, unlike in most other contexts, no doctor working in the public sector in Nigeria has a contract or specification that states what the clinical expectations are in terms of the service he/she is delivering.  There are no contracts with surgeons that state how many cases they are contracted to do, or how many patients physicians are expected to see. This also applies to other categories of health workers; and crucially also applies at institutional level. There are no process indicators, no quality indicators, no outcome indicators and definitely no patient satisfaction indicators. We do not know how many patients each public health facility is expected to see or what standard of service they are supposed to deliver. So there is absolutely no way for government (us) to know if we are getting value for money. We can pay salaries as high as we like, but until we link pay and funding to performance, nothing will change.  Although this has never happened, it is only a matter of time, until government starts asking for value for money from the sector.\nThe patients will always return: This is an assumption that we are glad to say is already being proven wrong. Patients will not always return, even those at the poorer end of the socioeconomic spectrum. A tour round many of the teaching and other public hospitals will reveal that many beds are empty, and increasingly so. There is a quiet evolution going on in the private health care sector in Nigeria. Previously, the sector was inherently inefficient with many two to four bed hospitals, whose ineffective management tended to charge over-the-top fees for the handful of patients unfortunate enough to end up in their care. This is changing, as a series of innovative groups are pulling together resources to build clinical collaborations that will enable high utilisation of services, lower costs and better care in the private sector.  Once this gains momentum, there will be less and less of a reason to go to many of the public sector hospitals. It will only be a matter of time for government to realise that they cannot continue funding these hospitals, when patients seek their care elsewhere.  Money will begin to follow the patient.\nStriking workers will always return to their jobs: This is the strongest of all the assumptions. However, staff of NITEL and NEPA also once thought that they would always have their jobs. If there are insufficient patients in most public sector hospitals and these hospitals are forced to close, the inevitable consequence is that there will simply be nothing to do in them. This is a natural consequence; it can be slowed, but cannot be stopped.\nThere are only two possible end points for the scenario playing out in the Nigerian public health care sector at the tertiary level; complete disintegration of the publicly delivered tertiary health care (similar to what happened with NITEL, NEPA) or a complete turn around. As it stands, the health  sector is surely and firmly walking towards self-destruction.  Too many health professions in Nigeria are so focused on their professional interests and egos that they seem to have lost sight of the bigger picture. In fighting for the ball, we are destroying it. If this continues, the outcome is inevitable. There will be nothing left to fight over.\nThe need has never been greater for real leadership to emerge from the professional bodies that will be willing to put the patient as the client front and centre of their action. There may only be a tiny window of opportunity to change course. Chances are that it is already too late\u2026 and that the downward spiral is well on its way.\nStill, we grasp for even a hint of light at the end of the tunnel, that our hopes may rise once again."}, {"author": "Chikwe Ihekweazu", "headline": "Can technology-based measurement transform the Nigerian Health Sector?", "body": "Can technology-based measurement transform the Nigerian Health Sector?\n0\nBy Chikwe Ihekweazu on Africa Diaspora Health Nigeria Technology\nThe Nigerian Banking Sector is almost unrecognizable compared to where it was just a few years ago. As a consumer, you can get cash from almost any ATM in Nigeria, transact business in any bank, pay for goods by mobile phone, and confirm transactions in seconds. You have access to statements 24/7, at least as long as there is connectivity. In addition to increasing the ease of transactions, the other major impact of these changes has been increased accountability and transparency, not just for the banks but for every individual or firm using bank services.\nIn contrast, our public sector hospitals these days seem to be constantly shut as one of several groups of health professionals is almost always on strike. While we may guess, we really do not know the impact this has on the Nigerian Health Sector. It is almost impossible to get data on how many surgeries surgeons actually carry out in our teaching hospitals or how many deliveries the midwives have performed in a month. What if we knew how many contact-hours medical students had with patients before being released to the world with that god-like title of \u201cDoctor\u201d? Would it make a difference to the perception we have of our apparently great healthcare institutions if we actually knew what they were \u201cproducing\u201d per naira of funds allocated? As budgets tighten for our governments, these questions will get even louder because healthcare is an expensive business. The biggest irony of all salary negotiations with health sector professionals in Nigeria is that they take place in the absence of any data on productivity.\nI have been reading about one of the greatest technology personalities of our time, more so since his interest in the health sector has grown; Bill Gates. One philosophy of his that has stuck with me is his reputed obsession for measurement. In his annual letter in 2013, Gates makes the case for how measurement has driven some of the biggest recent public health successes of this era. There is no doubt that improved data collection and sharing in Nigeria has been critical to the recent progress on polio in Nigeria.\nIncreasing accountability, efficiency and profitability in the health sector is not possible without the tools for measurement. Technology, especially mobile, has the power to transform the delivery of healthcare services and improve compliance, accountability and care. Driven by some of the fastest mobile subscriber growth in the world, cheaper mobile devices, and continued innovation, emerging mobile health solutions are already saving lives \u2013 an estimated 1 million of them by 2017, according to a recentreport by PricewaterhouseCoopers.\nDespite the growing interest in Mobile Health (mHealth) initiatives globally, adoption rates of mobile solutions has been slow in Nigeria. An emerging opportunity exists for healthcare providers to adopt mobile technology to not only to improve the effectiveness of healthcare delivery but to also measure and demonstrate results.\nWhile the sector is eager for mHealth solutions, most care providers in Nigeria still lack the required infrastructure to support widespread deployment of apps that might integrate personal medical information. Healthcare organisations will need to start from the basics, e.g. the deployment of Electronic Medical Records (EMR) systems, from which relevant data can be extracted and integrated into mobile health apps. When you consider that one of the major hospital groups in Nigeria, Lagoon hospitals only announced a full adoption of electronic medical records in 2013, it demonstrates how far the distance still is. Most medical records of patients in Nigeria are stored in folders as shown below.\nPaper Records at a Nigerian Hospital\nOne firm that is making progress in this space is Sabaoth Technologies Ltd, an all-purpose medical information systems firm, which is currently providing hospital information management systems to the Delta State University Teaching Hospital, Oghara and University College Hospital Ibadan in the public sector as well as several private hospitals.\nThere are other firms now making inroads into the health space. If you have not heard about the IT and logistics platform Integrahealth, note the name. Their flagship product \u2018DrugStock\u2019 enables the purchase of good quality drugs, managing the supply chain, payments, and capacity building for medium size hospitals mostly in Lagos, Nigeria. The co-founder Chibuzor Opara was at the World Economic Forumthis year speaking about their dream of increasing efficiency of hospitals in Nigeria and beyond.\nEarly in 2015, the Private Sector Health Alliance hosted \u201cThe Health Innovation Challenge;\u201d a multi-stage competition to recognise, reward and celebrate innovations that show potential to improve health in Nigeria. Several innovative firms and ideas competed for the challenge and some of these ideas will grow to dominate the sector in their niches in a few years.\nThere are also several examples from outside our shores. In Zambia, the government partnered with IBM to deploy a mobile program aimed at better managing the inventory and delivery of 200 life-saving prescription drugs. Staff members from three local health facilities are now using mobile devices with barcode scanners to record stock and generate real-time views of supplies. The solution also allows workers to transfer supplies and identify trends, thereby preventing gaps in the medical supply chain and ensuring that citizens have access to the medications they need.\nWhether it is in the public or private sectors, demands for data and information for multiple purposes, including performance improvement, accountability, and stakeholder decision making, are likely to increase in the future.  At the same time, there is a growing tech community with technology startups, developers and a fast-moving technology ecosystem which has been dubbed Silicon Lagoon.\nThe reason we are not measuring enough in the public sector is not because we lack the tools or the technology. It is also not for a lack of need or demand, but mostly it is because it\u2019s convenient for many not to measure, so that we do not know. Ignorance, for them, is bliss\u2026\nIf we want to transform our health sector, we must begin to measure performance. We may be shocked by what we find.\n  P/s: If you know of  projects, initiatives, ideas using technology innovatively in our health sector please share with us on twitter @nighealthwatch"}, {"author": "Chikwe Ihekweazu", "headline": "Liberia is declared Ebola free: can Nigeria support its Neighbours more?", "body": "Thankfully, Liberia is on its way back. The Ebola outbreak has been declared over, and life is returning to \u201cnormal\u201d. The streets are full of activity, and schools have reopened. Across the country, there is an unmistakable sense that people are desperate to get on with their lives.\nArriving Monrovia in January 2015, it felt familiar; like a mid-sized Nigerian town \u2013 perhaps Abakiliki or Ilorin. The food was familiar \u2013 fish, plantain, rice \u2026 with lots of red pepper. The electricity situation was still very poor, and most people in Monrovia relied on generators. As we drove past a white compound, the driver explained that it belonged to Charles Taylor. I shuddered as I thought of all the lives lost in a senseless civil war. About half a kilometer down the road, we passed another big white building on the left of Tubman Boulevard. It had \u201cNigeria House\u201d boldly inscribed on it. It\u2019s the Nigerian High Commission. The driver went on to explain with a sense of gratitude and respect the role that Nigeria had played in Liberia\u2019s history. I could not remember any other country that I had been to where I consistently had received such a warm welcome as in Liberia. I was proud.\nThe UN still had a military mission in Liberia. In the UN compound, there was a mix of military and police uniformed guys all around. I immediately noticed the uniform of the Nigerian police in the mix. The good work done by Nigeria around the sub-continent is often not recognised enough by Nigerians at home. Monrovia, Liberia\u2019s capital is home to about a third of the 4 million Liberians.  As is almost always the case, I ran into a number of Nigerian colleagues working in the various organisations responding to the outbreak, and we soon formed a tight bond. I slowly found my way around Monrovia.\nFrom the outside, with all the horror stories of Ebola in the popular press, it is easy to imagine Liberia as a country on the brink, especially with its history of protracted conflicts and civil war. But there is nothing further from the truth. Yes, it had been ill prepared for an outbreak of this severity and magnitude, as many other countries would have been, but sometimes there is nothing as powerful as grief to unite people in seeking a better future. The most important line of defence for Liberia is to rebuild the confidence of its population in the capacity of its government to prioritize the health of its citizens. This will require a complete turnaround in its health system\u2019s capacity to respond to the \u201croutine\u201d health needs of a population. It\u2019s only by responding to these issues in \u201cpeacetime\u201d and building trust, that it will have the capacity to respond better to the next crisis. When a society loses confidence in those to whom they would normally turn to in times of need, they resort to actions that can generally be considered \u201cirrational\u201d and \u201cillogical\u201d and unwittingly spread the disease further.\nIn order to rebuild their health system, Liberia will need the support of other West African countries, especially Nigeria.  At the beginning of the outbreak, Liberia was widely reported to have about 50 doctors working in the country;  one of the lowest physician-to-population ratios in the world. In Nigeria, there are over 30 medical colleges producing about 3,000 doctors annually. Perhaps, it is time to form strong regional alliances between the various postgraduate colleges in a win-win situation  including training and service for all the countries in the region. The same concept could apply to nursing professionals, pharmacists and medical laboratory scientists. However, this will only work if we are able to go about this with humility and a sense of service, not one of pride and arrogance.  \nFor Nigeria, it is time to think of our engagement with the sub-continent beyond the military and the police. Not many people may know about the \u201cTechnical Aid Corps (TAC)\u201d scheme that was established by the military regime of General Ibrahim Babangida in 1987 (like many other important institutions in Nigeria, it has no website for the public to follow its work). The sole purpose of the scheme is assisting States in Africa, Caribbean and specific regions in their social-economic development effort. Nigerian experts in various fields of human endeavour participate. Its most recent deployments are reported to be Uganda and Rwanda. Rwanda? I can guess what you are thinking! Until we begin to hold these Nigerian institutions to account on how they represent the strategic interests of our country, we cannot expect much to change.\nOut of this crisis must emerge a new Liberia. While the stories of dictators, civil war and Ebola are true, they cannot be Liberia\u2019s \u201csingle story\u201d. With a beautiful beach front right at the heart of the city, there is no reason for Monrovia not to be the favorite destination of Nigeria\u2019s emerging middle class. As Liberia grows, it will also begin to engage with the various opportunities in Nigeria. The earlier we really begin to see West-Africa for the common market that it should be, the greater the opportunities will be for the continent.\nFor now, it\u2019s just great that Liberia can get on with the difficult task of nation building."}, {"author": "Chikwe Ihekweazu", "headline": "Something to be proud of: Nigeria\u2019s Role in the AU Response to the Ebola Outbreak", "body": "There is increasing optimism that we will get to the end of the Ebola epidemic that has so badly affected Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea over the past year. In the first week of April, the lowest number of cases (30) were reported since May 2014. While there may still be some challenges ahead, the scale of the response and the translation of several learning points from the early part of the response have led to the quiet optimism that the end is in sight. This optimism is shared by responding organisations as well as health care workers in the most affected countries. Most of the current conversations have begun to focus on the restoration of health services with a strict infection control and prevention component. One organisation that has played a major role in this response but not gotten as much credit as it deserves is the \u201cAfrican Union\u201d (AU).\nWhile I was in Liberia earlier this year supporting the Ebola respose, I worked with epidemiologists, doctors, nurses, pharmacists and public health officers that are part of the African Union Support to Ebola Outbreak in West Africa (ASEOWA). ASEOWA is the African Union\u2019s contribution to on-going efforts to stop the transmission of the Ebola Virus Disease (EVD) in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone. Under Operation ASEOWA, health professionals were mobilized from around the African continent and deployed to the affected countries to assist with outbreak control efforts. This is the first time ever that the AU is initiating and implementing a mission of this size in response to a health crisis on the continent. The mission has  contributed significantly both in supporting the public health as well as clinical response to the outbreak. It contributed epidemiologists, who became part of the outbreak response activities, and clinicians supporting the restoration of critical health services.\nThe ASEOWA team of close to a thousand colleagues was made up of large contingents from Nigeria, Kenya and Ethiopia. Being Africans themselves, most of the ASEOWA team quickly integrated into various aspects of the response and rapidly gained the confidence of local colleagues. Whenever necessary, they joined teams in the field, going to some of the \u201chardest-to-reach\u201d areas to support various outbreak control activities. As the cases began to decline, members of the team were increasingly deployed into healthcare facilities to support activities that would lead to the restoration of services to the population. They acted not just as rare clinical resource in this situation but also provided emotional support and inspiration to other colleagues who felt exhausted and anxious after months of working under such difficult circumstances.\nThis being the first deployment of human resources in a health mission ever by the AU, there were some teething problems. Some colleagues had to wait longer than necessary before they were deployed to specific roles, and there were some uncertainties about where exactly their skills could be optimally utilised within the large response. The deployment of close to a thousand colleagues also required significant human resources management and logistics. There will definitely be many lessons to learn.  A comprehensive and independent evaluation of Operation ASEOWA is needed to learn vital lessons, both from the deployed individuals and the receiving countries\nThe large Nigerian delegation was ably led by Dr Joshua Obasanya, deployed from the Nigerian Centre for Disease Control. He was until recently the Director of Nigeria\u2019s Tuberculosis Control Program so came with years of experience of managing not only one of the oldest diseases known to man but one that had similar difficult elements that are key to the control such as \u201ccontact tracing\u201d. He was also part of the team that contained the outbreak of Ebola in Nigeria.\n\n\nDr Obasanya, leader of the Nigerian Delegation and Deputy Head of the ASEOWA team in Liberia\nThere have been recent pronouncements about the potential establishment of an \u201cAfrican Centre for Disease Control\u201d, maybe following the European model \u201cEuropean Centre for Disease Control\u201d. While this is a great idea on face value, it may be a bit premature. Right now, priority should be given to strengthen each country\u2019s capacity to carry out their statutory responsibility of responding to infectious disease threats in their own countries. In addition, the international health regulations actually provide an excellent framework for action from the international community when this is needed. While there is general agreement that this may not have worked optimally in this response, emphasis should be laid on strengthening capacity in individual countries rather than creating new organisations with uncertain mandates. The primary responsibility of preventing, managing and controlling infectious disease threats should remain firmly with each country.\nHowever, in exceptional circumstances like this, the AU should indeed be well placed to mobilize resources from countries like Nigeria, and it has done this fairly successfully during this response. Hopefully, there will be many lessons to be learnt, so that, while we are grateful for all the help from outside, the skills and experience gained by African colleagues on this mission will serve the continent well.\nWe look forward to welcoming those of our ASEOWA colleagues, who are still in the field, back home."}, {"author": "Chikwe Ihekweazu", "headline": "ON WORLD TB DAY, THERE IS LITTLE TO CELEBRATE IN NIGERIA", "body": "First published on Nigeria Health Watch.\nAs the Ebola epidemic in West Africa slows and falls away from the headlines, there is a temptation to view this outbreak as an isolated event and go back to life as usual. In Nigeria, the fairly successful response to the Ebola epidemic has brought a bit of credibility to the Nigerian health sector, with many Nigerian public health professionals smiling when confronted with the question \u201cHow did you guys do it?\u201d While there is definitely some satisfaction to be gained in the response to the Ebola outbreak in Nigeria, it does not change the fact that we are still in a precarious situation with several other infectious disease threats, which kill thousands of people in Nigeria. No other disease illustrates better our collective inability to deliver the essentials of a modern public health response to those who need help the most, in the most timely and efficient manner, than our response to tuberculosis (TB).\nWhile diseases like Ebola kill swiftly and produce horrific and acute symptoms, TB consumes many of its unknowing victims over a long period. It often goes undiagnosed for months, if not years, while it multiplies in families and communities. People infected with TB are often poor, marginalised and voiceless. Individuals who are ill with TB and not treated, can spread the bacteria through the air. Without correct treatment, more than 80 percent of people who fall ill will eventually waste away \u2014 coughing up blood while their bodies are ravaged by the disease \u2014 until they die. The difference is that they do not die in days, but in months \u2026 sometimes years.\nFor many years, there has been widespread suspicion that most of the cases of TB occurring in Nigeria are not detected by the system and are never able to access care. Under-diagnosis is probably the most significant reason for the low numbers of cases reported in Nigeria. TB diagnosis and care is only available in the public sector and in a few faith-based healthcare facilities. However, these sites are very unappealing for patients, as they are often poorly maintained inaccessible and located at the corners of hospitals.\nThe derelict \u201cChest Unit\u201d of the University of Nigeria Teaching Hospital (UNTH) hidden away at its old site\nThe first ever population based TB prevalence survey, (an attempt at measuring the burden of TB ) was conducted in Nigeria in 2012. Data from this survey provides some context to the low case notification data. The survey revealed a doubling of the estimated overall prevalence (the total number of people with TB) and a tripling of the estimated incidence (the total number of new cases) from previous WHO estimates. Based on the survey\u2019s findings, Nigeria\u2019s population of 170 million , in 2012, the estimated number of new cases of all forms of TB should have been about 550,000. However, Nigeria notified a total of only 97,000 new cases of all forms of TB in 2012, revealing a huge gap in case detection. Using these updated figures, Nigeria\u2019s case detection rate for all forms of TB currently stands at approximately 17 percent, one of the lowest case detection rates in the world. Based on the 2012 prevalence survey data, the country and WHO have updated their estimates for TB prevalence and incidence in Nigeria. This data is publicly available here.\nIn recent decades, we\u2019ve seen a surge in the number of people falling ill with strains of TB that are highly resistant to conventional treatment , which left untreated, kill rapidly. These strains are called multi drug resistant tuberculosis (MDR TB). Overall, the mean annual percentage increase in MDR-TB exceeded 100% in Nigeria, while MDR-TB case detection in 2012 was <10%. This means that most of the estimated 3,000 case of MDR TB in Nigeria are not diagnosed and do not enter the care pathway.\nAll over the world, tuberculosis is a difficult disease \u2013 difficult to diagnose and difficult to treat. But for the first time in years there is some real excitement on the TB scene with more rapid accurate diagnostic tools becoming available. Xpert MTB/RIF is a new test that simultaneously detects both the bacteria that causes TB and resistance to rifampicin, one of the main drugs used for its treatment directly from sputum in under two hours. WHO has recommended the use of the technology since December 2010 and is monitoring its global roll-out to promote coordination. A list of all the sites that have procured this new diagnostic option can be found here.\nMore than ever before, the Ebola outbreak presents the responsible public health departments and agencies in Nigeria with an opportunity to engage the attention of the Nigerian people to call for collective action to prevent future outbreaks and build capacity to respond to ongoing ones. We have a moral obligation to lend our voices to this broader struggle. We have learnt from the HIV/AIDS global epidemic that robust health systems are critical in mounting and sustaining a vigorous response to an emerging disease threat. This 2014 Ebola outbreak provides a unique opportunity to rebuild and strengthen health systems and should lead to much more robust investment in public health.\nTo find out how Nigeria has spent the US$ 147,354,856 that it received from the Global Fund in grants since the inception of the fund, go to their website here. To find out more about the Nigerian National TB Control Program, we would normally refer you to their website, but \u2026 it is \u201cdown\u201d. To find data on TB in Nigeria, sadly, you will have to go to the WHO website here.\nOn World TB Day, 24 March, WHO is calling for new commitments and new action in the global fight against tuberculosis. The call is most urgent in Nigeria. We are sitting and watching a ticking bomb. With the release of the first ever nationwide MDR TB and TB Prevalence surveys in Nigeria, one would have expected a massive scale up in the response, but very little seems to have changed \u2026"}][{"author": "Alec Ross", "headline": "The advice Shimon Peres gave me years ago that I'll always remember", "body": "Let me share a personal story about Nobel Peace Prize winner Shimon Peres, who passed away yesterday, and the enduring lessons of that story.\nA number of years ago, I was a young diplomat in Italy and scheduled to have a foreign policy debate with well-known former Ambassador to the United Nations, John Bolton. I knew that Bolton would not have heard of me, would not prepare, and would not particularly care about the sensibilities of the audience, which was made up of several hundred prominent executives, mostly Italian CEOs. When we met, he did not look at me, he just looked over my shoulder to see if someone more important or famous might be around. I\u2019m sure ambassador Bolton probably thought sharing the stage with some young guy was beneath him.\nI volunteered that the ambassador should go first, given his standing. He accepted and delivered a monologue that had little to do with the topic. Just the well-known one-liners and doctrine of ambassador John Bolton. His greatest hits, so to speak. None of it responded to the specific interests of the businessmen in the audience.\nI had prepared thoroughly, and after ambassador Bolton made his points, I responded with my opening remarks in Italian and included a joke that got everyone laughing, which Bolton of course could not understand since he did not speak Italian. I pulled two or three other little things like that, which were a product of preparation and caring about who was in the audience.\nBottom line, the young unknown diplomat destroyed the celebrity. Afterwards, Shimon Peres (who was sitting in the front row) came up to me and whispered in his distinct, gravelly voice, \"young man, you have demonstrated how to engage in asymmetrical warfare.\" We spoke later that night, and he told me that whenever a lesser experienced or lesser known person goes into competition with someone more experienced and better known, to make that person\u2019s standing a weaknesses. To match his lazy preparation with over-preparation. To match his seriousness and arrogance with a measure of levity and two measures of humility. Bolton was so humiliated that he did not come to dinner that night and left the conference a day early.\nFour weeks ago, I saw president Peres again. We were both back in Italy at the same place on Lake Como. We had our last conversation, discussing Russia, while drinking wine on a gorgeous Italian night. At the beginning of our conversation, I re-introduced myself to him. He smiled and said, \u201cI know who you are and I remember our conversation after the debate many years ago about asymmetrical combat. I know who you are because even though I am 93-years-old, I still prepare every day as though I am still a young man without the benefit of power and standing.\u201d President Peres explained to me that he read the biographies of everybody that would be at dinner and this reminded him of our earlier encounter. He was exhibiting the lessons that he ingrained when he was my age: preparation, understanding your surroundings and not relying on experience and celebrity.\nThat a 93-year-old Nobel Peace Prize winning president of a nation can do this until the end of his life inspires me to try to do the same.\nAlec Ross is the author of The Industries of the Future, from Simon & Schuster."}, {"author": "Alec Ross", "headline": "An open letter from technology sector leaders on Donald Trump\u2019s candidacy for President", "body": "We are inventors, entrepreneurs, engineers, investors, researchers, and business leaders working in the technology sector.

The coming decade will see societies transform as humans learn to live alongside robots.\nJapan is home to the longest-living citizens on earth and the biggest elderly population of any country\u2014and it\u2019s not getting any younger. Japan\u2019s current life expectancy is 80 years for men and 87 years for women and is expected to rise to 84 and 91, respectively, over the next 45 years. Between 2010 and 2025, the number of Japanese citizens 65 years or older is expected to increase by 7 million. Today, 25 percent of Japan\u2019s population is age 65 or older. By 2020, this is projected to increase to 29 percent and reach 39 percent by 2050.\nAll of those long-living elderly will need caretakers. Yet Japan\u2019s low birthrates mean that what once was a staple of Japanese family life\u2014taking care of one\u2019s grandparents and great-grandparents\u2014will no longer be a viable model at the scale the nation needs. There will not be enough grandchildren.\nWith Japan\u2019s persistently strict immigration policies curtailing the number of workers in the country, there will not be enough humans around to do the job at all. Japan\u2019s Ministry of Health, Labor, and Welfare predicts a need for 4 million eldercare nurses by 2025. Right now there are only 1.49 million in the country. Japan allows only 50,000 work visas annually, and unless something drastic changes, the math does not work.\nThis labor shortage will hit service-industry jobs like eldercare with ferocity and will be exacerbated because caretakers have a high job turnover rate due to low pay and high rates of work-related injury from lifting patients.\nEnter the robots.\nOur future caretakers are being developed in a Japanese factory right now. Just as Japanese companies reinvented cars in the 1970s and consumer electronics in the 1980s, they are now reinventing the family. The robots depicted in the movies and cartoons of the 1960s and 1970s will become the reality of the 2020s.\nRival Japanese companies Toyota and Honda are leveraging their expertise in mechanical engineering to invent the next generation of robots. Toyota built a nursing aide named Robina\u2014modeled after Rosie, the cartoon robot nanny and housekeeper in The Jetsons\u2014as part of their Partner Robot Family, a line of robots to take care of the world\u2019s growing geriatric population. Robina is a \u201cfemale\u201d robot, 60 kilograms in weight and 1.2 meters tall, that can communicate using words and gestures. She has wide-set eyes, a moptop hairdo, and even a flowing white metallic skirt.\nRobina\u2019s brother, Humanoid, serves as a multipurpose home assistant. He can do the dishes, take care of your parents when they\u2019re sick, and even provide impromptu entertainment: one model plays the trumpet, another the violin. Both versions are doppelgangers for the famous Star Wars C-3PO robot, although in gleaming white instead of gold.\nIn response, Honda has created ASIMO (the Advanced Step in Innovative Mobility robot), a fully functional humanoid that looks like a four-foot-tall astronaut stuck on Earth. ASIMO is sophisticated enough to interpret human emotions, movements, and conversation. Equipped with cameras that function as eyes, ASIMO can follow voice commands, shake hands, and answer questions with a nod or by voice. He even bows to greet others, demonstrating good Japanese manners. For an elderly patient, ASIMO can fulfill a range of tasks, from helping the patient get out of bed to holding a conversation.\nHonda is also focusing much of its research and commercialization on robotic limbs and assistance devices that are robotic but not free-standing robots. Its Walking Assist device wraps around the legs and back of people with weakened leg muscles, giving them extra power to move on their own. In the future, expect to see Honda making robotic hands and arms. Its goal is nothing less than helping paraplegics walk and the very frail rediscover the speed and power of their youth.\nNumerous other Japanese companies are pushing the big players like Toyota and Honda. Tokai Rubber Industries, in conjunction with the Japanese research institute RIKEN, has unveiled the Robot for Interactive Body Assistance (RIBA), which can pick up and set down humans up to 175 pounds and is designed for patient comfort: it resembles a giant smiling bear and is covered in a soft skin to guard against injury or pain.\nSimilarly, Japanese industrial automation company AIST has created PARO, a robot baby harp seal covered in soft white fur. PARO exhibits many of the same behaviors as a real pet. Designed for those who are too frail to care for a living animal or who live in environments that don\u2019t allow pets, such as nursing homes, it enjoys being held, gets angry when hit, and likes to nap.When President Barack Obama met PARO a few years ago on a tour of Japanese robotics innovations, he instinctually reached out and rubbed its head and back. It looks like a cute stuffed animal, but costs $6,000 and is classified by the US government as a class 2 medical device.\nJapan already leads the world in robotics, operating 310,000 of the 1.4 million industrial robots in existence across the world. It\u2019s turning to eldercare robots in part because it has to and in part because it, uniquely, is in a great position to leverage its advanced industrial technology toward the long assembly line of the human life span. But can robots really take care of humans?\n\u201cFor the idea of artificial companionship to be our new normal, we have to change ourselves, and in the process we are remaking human values and human connection.\u201d \u2014 Sherry Turkle, MIT professor\nJapan\u2019s private and public sectors certainly think so. In 2013, the Japanese government granted $24.6 million to companies focusing on eldercare robotics. Japan\u2019s prominent Ministry of Economy, Trade, and Industry chose 24 companies in May 2013 to receive subsidies covering one-half to two-thirds of the R&D costs for nursing care robots. Tasks for these robots include helping the elderly move between rooms; keeping tabs on those likely to wander; and providing entertainment through games, singing, and dancing.\nNevertheless, difficult challenges remain. On the technical side, it remains difficult to design robots capable of intimate activities like bathing patients or brushing their teeth. And most Japanese companies that are developing these robots specialize in industrial motors and electronic automation. They didn\u2019t enter the caretaking field with a keen grasp of how to forge an emotional connection, a crucial aspect of eldercare. Even as they improve, some observers\u2014 like Sherry Turkle, a professor of the social studies of science and technology at MIT\u2014question whether patients will ever be able to form a true emotional connection with robot caretakers. As Turkle warns, \u201cFor the idea of artificial companionship to be our new normal, we have to change ourselves, and in the process we are remaking human values and human connection.\u201d\nIf robot nurses catch on, she explains, they may even create a chasm between younger and older generations. \u201cIt\u2019s not just that older people are supposed to be talking,\u201d Turkle argues, referring to the goal of creating robots that can hold conversation, \u201cyounger people are supposed to be listening. We are showing very little interest in what our elders have to say. We are building the machines that will literally let their stories fall on deaf ears.\u201d\nThese technical questions (Can a robot brush a person\u2019s teeth?) and almost-spiritual doubts (Can, and should, emotional connections be made between humans and robots?) are both valid. Yet robot technology and applicability continue to advance in Japan, and answers to these questions will likely arise there in the near future. With too few caretakers, I expect robots to become a regular part of the Japanese family system.\nIf the aging nation can pull it off, robot caretakers will be a boon for its economy and will soon make the jump to the global economy, with potentially far-reaching consequences.\nMuch of the rest of the industrialized world is on the verge of a period of advanced aging that will mirror Japan\u2019s own. In Europe, all 28 member states of the European Union have populations that are growing older, and in the decades ahead, the percentage of Europe\u2019s population aged 65 and older will grow from 17 percent to 30 percent. China is already entering a period of advanced aging even as it continues to develop. Although its one-child policy is already being phased out, China is now demographically lopsided. Chinese women have on average 1.4 children, well below the replacement rate of 2.1, resulting in too few young people to provide for the elderly. The notable exception is the United States, where immigration policies partially mitigate the effects of an aging population.\nAs the populations of developed nations continue to age, they create a big market for those Japanese robots. And caretaking robots, alongside robotic limb technology, may simply be the first in a new wave of complex robots entering our everyday lives. Robots will be the rare technology that reaches the mainstream through elderly users first, spreading down as grandma shows off her next cutting-edge gadget for the kids and grandkids.\nTHE GEO-ROBOTIC LANDSCAPE\nThe robot landscape will be vastly differentiated by country. Just as wealthier and poorer citizens reside at different technological levels, so do wealthier and poorer countries.\nA few countries have already established themselves as leading robot societies. About 70 percent of total robot sales take place in Japan, China, the United States, South Korea, and Germany\u2014known as the \u201cbig five\u201d in robotics. Japan, the United States, and Germany dominate the landscape in high-value industrial and medical robots, and South Korea and China are major producers of less expensive consumer-oriented robots. While Japan records the highest number of robot sales, China represents the most rapidly growing market, with sales increasing by 25 percent every year since 2005.\nThere is quite a gap between the big five and the rest of the world. As both consumers and producers of robots, these countries outpace all others. By way of illustration, the number of industrial robots produced in South Korea, a country of 50 million people, is several times greater than the number produced in South America, Central America, Africa, and India combined, with populations totaling 2.8 billion. Russia is effectively a nonplayer in robotics despite its industrial base. It neither produces nor buys robots to any significant degree, instead maintaining extractive industries (natural gas, oil, iron, nickel) and industrial manufacturing plants that look and function the way they did in the 1970s and 1980s.\nRobots will be the rare technology that reaches the mainstream through elderly users first, spreading down as grandma shows off her next cutting-edge gadget for the kids and grandkids.\nThe big five\u2019s comparative advantage might even accelerate in the future, for these are the same countries that are most likely to incorporate the next generation of robotics into society, work, and home. They will own the name brands in consumer robots, and they\u2019ll power the software and networks that enable the robotics ecosystem. When I think about this symbiosis, I think about the Internet in the 1990s. It was not just the consumer-facing Internet companies that were born and based in Silicon Valley; it was also the network equipment makers like Cisco Systems and Juniper Networks. Today Cisco and Juniper have a combined 85,000 employees and $154 billion in market value. The same types of back-end systems will exist in the robotics industry. And the big five countries will benefit from being home to the high-paying jobs and wealth accumulation that go with being out ahead of the 191 other countries around the world. They will produce the Ciscos and Junipers of robotics.\nInterestingly, less developed countries might be able to leapfrog technologies as they enter the robot landscape. Countries in Africa and Central Asia have been able to go straight to cell phones without building landline telephones, and in the same way they might be able to jump ahead in robotics without having to establish an advanced industrial base.\nThe African Robotics Network (AFRON) offers a good model. A community of individuals and institutions, AFRON hosts events and projects to boost robotics-related education, research, and industry on the continent. Through initiatives like its 10 Dollar Robot Challenge, AFRON encourages the development of extremely low-cost robotics education. One winner was RoboArm, a project from Obafemi Awolowo University in Nigeria whose armlike structure is made out of plastic and runs on scavenged motors. The ability to generate low-cost innovation based on scarcity of materials is rooted in the concept of frugal innovation.\nAs robotics starts to spread, the degree to which countries can succeed in the robot era will depend in part on culture\u2014on how readily people accept robots into their lives. Western and Eastern cultures are highly differentiated in how they view robots. Not only does Japan have an economic need and the technological know-how for robots, but it also has a cultural predisposition. The ancient Shinto religion, practiced by 80 percent of Japanese, includes a belief in animism, which holds that both objects and human beings have spirits. As a result, Japanese culture tends to be more accepting of robot companions as actual companions than is Western culture, which views robots as soulless machines. In a culture where the inanimate can be considered to be just as alive as the animate, robots can be seen as members of society rather than as mere tools or as threats.\nIn contrast, fears of robotics are deeply seated in Western culture. The threat of humanity creating things we cannot control pervades Western literature, leaving a long history of cautionary tales. Prometheus was condemned to an eternity of punishment for giving fire to humans. When Icarus flew too high, the sun melted his ingenious waxed wings and he fell to his death. In Mary Shelley\u2019s Frankenstein, Dr. Frankenstein\u2019s grotesque creation wreaks havoc and ultimately leads to its creator\u2019s death\u2014and numerous B-movie remakes.\nThis fear does not pervade Eastern culture to the same extent. The cultural dynamic in Japan is representative of the culture through much of East Asia, enabling the Asian robotics industry to speed ahead, unencumbered by cultural baggage. Investment in robots reflects a cultural comfort with robots, and, in China, departments of automation are well represented and well respected in the academy. There are more than 100 automation departments in Chinese universities, compared with approximately 76 in the United States despite the larger total number of universities in the United States.\nIn South Korea, teaching robots are seen in a positive light; in Europe, they are viewed negatively. As with eldercare, in Europe robots are seen as machines, whereas in Asia they are viewed as potential companions. In the United States, the question is largely avoided because of an immigration system that facilitates the entry of new, low-cost labor that often ends up in fields that might otherwise turn to service robots. In the other parts of the world, attitudes often split the difference. A recent study in the Middle East showed that people would be open to a humanoid household-cleaning robot but not to robots that perform more intimate and influential roles such as teaching. The combination of cultural, demographic, and technological factors means that we will get our first glimpse of a world full of robots in East Asia.\nHUMANIZING ROBOTS\nThe first wave of labor substitution from automation and robotics came from jobs that were often dangerous, dirty, and dreary and involved little personal interaction, but increasingly, robots are encroaching on jobs in the service sector that require personalized skills. Jobs in the service sector that were largely immune from job loss during the last stage of globalization are now at risk because advances in robotics have accelerated in recent years, due to breakthroughs in the field itself as well as new advancements in information management, computing, and high-end engineering. Tasks once thought the exclusive domain of humans\u2014the types of jobs that require situational awareness, spatial reasoning and dexterity, contextual understanding, and human judgment\u2014are opening up to robots.\nTwo key developments have dovetailed to make this possible: improvements in modeling belief space and the uplink of robots to the cloud. Belief space refers to a mathematical framework that allows us to model a given environment statistically and develop probabilistic outcomes. It is basically the application of algorithms to make sense of new or messy contexts. For robots, modeling belief space opens the way for greater situational awareness. It has led to breakthroughs in areas like grasping, once a difficult robot task. Until recently belief space was far too complex to sufficiently compute, a task made all the more difficult by the limited sets of robot experience available to analyze. But advances in data analytics have combined with exponentially greater sets of experiential robot data to enable programmers to develop robots that can now intelligently interact with their environment.\nThe recent exponential growth of robot data is due largely to the development of cloud robotics, a term coined by Google researcher James Kuffner in 2010. Linked to the cloud, robots can access vast troves of data and shared experience to enhance the understanding of their own belief space. Before being hooked up to the cloud, robots had access to very limited data\u2014either their own experience or that of a narrow cluster of robots. They were stand-alone pieces of electronics with capabilities that were limited to the hardware and software inside the unit. But by becoming networked devices, constantly connected to the cloud, robots can now incorporate the experiences of every other robot of their kind, \u201clearning\u201d at an accelerating rate.\nImagine the kind of quantum leap that human culture would undertake if we were all suddenly given a direct link to the knowledge and experience of everyone else on the planet\u2014if, when we made a decision, we were drawing from not just our own limited experience and expertise but from that of billions of other people. Big data has enabled this quantum leap for the cognitive development of robots.\nWith a connection to the cloud, robots can now incorporate the experiences of every other robot of their kind, \u201clearning\u201d at an accelerating rate.\nAnother major development in robotics arrives through materials science, which has allowed robots to be constructed of new materials. Robots no longer have to be cased in the aluminum bodies of armor that characterized C-3PO or R2-D2. Today\u2019s robots can have bodies made of silicone, or even spider silk, that are eerily natural looking. Highly flexible components\u2014such as air muscles (which distribute power through tubes holding highly concentrated pressurized air), electroactive polymers (which change a robot\u2019s size and shape when stimulated by an electric field), and ferrofluids (basically magnetic fluids that facilitate more humanlike movement)\u2014have created robots that you might not even recognize as being artificial, almost like the Arnold Schwarzenegger cyborg in The Terminator. An imitation caterpillar robot designed by researchers at Tufts University to perform tasks as varied as finding land mines and diagnosing diseases is even biodegradable\u2014just like us.\nRobots are now also being built both bigger and smaller than ever before. Nanorobots, still in the early phases of development, promise a future in which autonomous machines at the scale of 10-9 meters (far, far smaller than a grain of sand) can diagnose and treat human diseases at the cellular level. On the other end of the spectrum, the world\u2019s largest walking robot is a German-made fire-breathing dragon that stands at 51 feet long, weighs 11 tons, and is filled with more than 20 gallons of stage blood. Apparently the Germans have a festival involving it.\nRecent advances will continue. It is not just Japan\u2019s government that is devoting ever-increasing resources to robotics. In the United States, President Obama launched the National Robotics Initiative in 2011 to stimulate development of robots for industrial automation, elder assistance, and military applications. Run by the National Science Foundation, the program has awarded more than $100 million in contracts. France has initiated a similar program, pledging $126.9 million to develop its industry and catch up to Germany. Sweden has similarly earmarked millions to give out to individuals and corporations through innovation awards such as Robotdalen (\u201crobot valley\u201d), launched in 2011.\nThe field of robotics is very much like where the world stood with the Internet 20 years ago. We are at the beginning of something: chapter one, page one.\nThe private sector is also investing at increasingly higher levels. Google purchased Boston Dynamics, a leading robotics design company with Pentagon contracts, for an untold sum in December 2013. It also bought DeepMind, a London-based artificial intelligence company founded by wunderkind Demis Hassabis. As a kid, Hassabis was the second-highest-ranked chess player in the world under the age of 14, and while he was getting his PhD in cognitive neuroscience, he was acknowledged by Science magazine for making one of the ten most important science breakthroughs of the year after developing a new biological theory for how imagination and memory work in the brain.\nAt DeepMind, Demis and his colleagues effectively created the computer equivalent of hand-eye coordination, something that had never been accomplished before in robotics. In a demo, Demis showed me how he had taught his computers how to play old Atari 2600 video games in the same way that humans play them, based on looking at a screen and adjusting actions through neural processes responding to an opponent\u2019s actions. He\u2019d taught computers how to think in much the way that humans do. Then Google bought DeepMind for half a billion dollars and is applying its expertise in machine learning and systems neuroscience to power the algorithms it is developing as it expands beyond Internet search and further into robotics.\nMost corporate research and development in robotics comes from within big companies (like Google, Toyota, and Honda), but venture capital funding in robotics is growing at a steep rate. It more than doubled in just three years, from $160 million in 2011 to $341 million in 2014. In its first year of investment, Grishin Robotics, a $25 million seed investment fund, evaluated more than 600 start-ups before coming to terms with the eight now in its portfolio. Singulariteam, a new Israeli venture capital fund, quickly raised two funds of $100 million each to invest in early-stage robotics and artificial intelligence. The appeal for investors is obvious: the market for consumer robots could hit $390 billion by 2017, and industrial robots should hit $40 billion in 2020.\nAs the technology continues to improve, there is an ongoing debate about just how radically human life will be transformed by advanced robots and whether robots will ultimately surpass us. One view in the debate is that it\u2019s inevitable robots will pass us; another is that they can\u2019t possibly compete with us; a third is that man and machine could merge. Within the robotics community, the future of technology is wrapped up in the concept of singularity, the theoretical point in time when artificial intelligence will match or surpass human intelligence. If singularity is achieved, it is unclear what the relationship between robots and humans will become. (In the Terminator series, once singularity is achieved, a self-aware computer system decides to launch a war on humans.)\nEnthusiasts for the singularity imagine that investments in robotics will do more than strengthen corporate balance sheets; they will radically enhance human well-being, eliminating mundane tasks and replacing diseased or aging parts of our bodies. The technology community is deeply divided about whether singularity is a good thing or a bad thing, with one camp believing it will enhance human experience as another camp, equally large, believes it will unleash a dystopian future where people become subservient to machines.\nBut will singularity occur?\nThose who believe that singularity will be achieved point to several key factors. First, they argue that Moore\u2019s law, which holds that the amount of computing power we can fit into a chip will double every two years, shows little sign of slowing down. Moore\u2019s law applies to the transistors and technology that control robots as well as those in computers. Add rapid advances in machine learning, data analytics, and cloud robotics, and it\u2019s clear that computing is going to keep rapidly improving. Those who argue for the singularity differ on when it will occur. Mathematician Vernor Vinge predicts that it will occur by 2023; futurist Ray Kurzweil says 2045. But the question looming over singularity is whether there\u2019s a limit on how far our technology can ultimately go.\nThose who argue against the possibility of singularity point to several factors. The software advances necessary to reach singularity demand a detailed scientific understanding of the human brain, but our lack of understanding about the basic neural structure of the brain impedes software development. Moreover, while weak artificial intelligence, whereby robots simply specialize in a specific function, is currently advancing exponentially, strong artificial intelligence, whereby robots demonstrate humanlike cognition and intelligence, is advancing only linearly. While inventions like IBM\u2019s Watson (the computer designed by IBM that beat Jeopardy! champions Ken Jennings and Brad Rutter) are exciting, scientists need a better understanding of the brain before these advances progress beyond winning a game show. Watson didn\u2019t actually \u201cthink\u201d; it was basically a very comprehensive search engine querying a large database. As robotics expert and UC Berkeley professor Ken Goldberg explains, \u201cRobots are going to become increasingly human. But the gap between humans and robots will remain\u2014it\u2019s so large that it will be with us for the foreseeable future.\u201d\nIt\u2019s my view that the current moment in the field of robotics is very much like where the world stood with the Internet 20 years ago. We are at the beginning of something: chapter one, page one. Just as it would have been difficult in the days of dial-up modems to imagine an Internet video service like YouTube streaming over 6 billion hours of video every month, it is difficult for us to imagine today that lifelike robots may walk the streets with us, work in the cubicle next to ours, or take our elderly parents for a walk and then help them with dinner.\nThis is not happening today and it will not happen tomorrow, but it will happen during most of our lifetimes. The level of investment in robotics, combined with advances in big data, network technologies, materials science, and artificial intelligence, are setting the foundation for the 2020s to produce breakthroughs in robotics that bring today\u2019s science fiction right into mainstream use.\nAlec Ross is the New York Times bestselling author of The Industries of the Future, recently released by Simon & Schuster.  You can read more here."}, {"author": "Alec Ross", "headline": "If Apple opens a backdoor for the FBI, expect the Chinese, Russians and non-state actors to enter, too", "body": "I spent many hours in the White House Situation room debating issues exactly like the one now playing out between Apple and the FBI regarding whether Apple must undermine its technology to give access to the FBI so it can retrieve data from the iPhone of a terrorist. \nI believe that liberty without security is fragile and security without liberty is oppressive. \nHowever, I also believe that the FBI\u2019s assertion that it needs Apple to break its technology in the name of security actually makes the United States and the rest of the world less secure, not more secure. \nLet\u2019s be clear about what the FBI is asking. They want Apple to hack its own product by building an entirely new version of its iOS software and they want it to deliberately have security holes and weakened encryption so that the FBI can access the data on iPhones. \nIf Apple does this, then the idea that only the FBI will be able to exploit this new vulnerability is na\u00efve. By mandating that companies undermine their own encryption, it opens vulnerabilities that weaken the integrity of security systems for everyone.\nIf a backdoor is built for the FBI, then I believe that the door is also open for the Chinese, the Russians, and for non-state based hackers to enter, too.\nWhat\u2019s more, if US policy requires mandatory assistance from companies to break encryption, it is certain that other countries will demand the same on the same precedent.  And unlike the United States, their motives will not necessarily be bound by the rule of law.  This puts American companies in an impossible position. \nThe FBI is not acting with malignant intent. This is no longer J. Edgar Hoover\u2019s FBI. However, by trying to solve a short-term problem (accessing the contents of a single terrorist\u2019s iPhone) they are creating a much bigger, long-term problem: opening access to once secure systems.\nAs more of our life is connected to the cloud, the idea that mandatory backdoors are built-in is a nightmare. In my book The Industries of the Future, I argue that as we store things like our medical records to the cloud, that we must make sure those systems are encrypted and secure. This means no mandatory backdoors. \nFor these reasons and others, intelligence agencies including the NSA and GCHQ have come out clearly in favor of strong encryption with no backdoors. Law enforcement has other methods to get access to data other than mandating decryption. \nFor all of our security, let\u2019s hope that Apple prevails on this issue and the FBI does not.\nAlec Ross is the author of The Industries of the Future, recently released by Simon & Schuster."}, {"author": "Alec Ross", "headline": "Silicon Valley dominated the world for 20 years. Who wins in the next 20 years, though, is still a very big question.", "body": "\u201cWe want to create our own Silicon Valley.\u201d\nIf there\u2019s a single sentence I\u2019ve heard in every country I\u2019ve been to, it\u2019s this one. Silicon Valley has been home to technology-driven innovation for a long time, but the 20-year period from 1994 to 2014 was something special.\nPeople all over the world witnessed a spectacular level of innovation and wealth creation, all emerging from a small 30-mile long, 15-mile-wide strip of Northern California. Other states and countries have been attempting to build the \u201cnext Silicon Valley\u201d for years now. At this point, there\u2019s even a formula.\nAs Marc Andreessen writes:\nThe popular recipe for creating the \u201cnext\u201d Silicon Valley goes something like this:\nBuild a big, beautiful, fully equipped technology park;\nMix in R&D labs and university centers;\nProvide incentives to attract scientists, firms and users;\nInterconnect the industry through consortia and specialized suppliers;\nProtect intellectual property and tech transfer;\nEstablish a favorable business environment and regulations.\nIt happens all the time all over the world. And it never works.\nWhen I\u2019m asked, \u201cWhat can we do to create our own Silicon Valley?\u201d my response surprises many people: \u201cYou can\u2019t,\u201d I say. \u201cIt\u2019s too late. Silicon Valley has a decades-long head start creating the perfect environment for creating Internet businesses. What you can do, though, is position your communities to compete and succeed in those areas of innovation that are still to come.\u201d\nThe development of fields such as genomics, robotics, and cyber will all benefit from the interventions that Andreessen listed. But for cities or countries seeking to create the next hotbed for any of these fields, there are also broader factors to consider.\nBuilding an innovation-rich place like Silicon Valley requires specific cultural and labor-market characteristics that can contradict both a society\u2019s norms and the more controlling impulses of government leaders. \nA critical factor: domain expertise\nWith the industries of the future \u2014 a topic I researched extensively as part of my new book \u2014 new avenues of opportunity for countries and people alike will hinge on domain expertise: deep knowledge about a single industry, which tends to concentrate in specific cities or regions. Detroit has domain expertise in cars, Paris has it in fashion, and Silicon Valley has it in Internet-based businesses.\nDomain expertise for the industries of the future is still broadly distributed. To understand domain expertise, consider the following question: Why do a ridiculously high percentage of Internet companies still come out of Silicon Valley when massive investment is being made around the world to compete with it? Many factors are at play, but domain expertise is the most important.\nFor more than 20 years, the world\u2019s best computer scientists have overwhelmingly been based in Silicon Valley. They could have been born anywhere, but they came to Silicon Valley for school (Stanford or Berkeley), employment (which creates a self-reinforcing cycle that concentrates talent), and investment (with the Valley offering far and away the most access to early-stage capital in the world). And they came to be included in a culture and community that placed the computer science engineer at the highest level of social status.\nThe Valley came to be not just any old industrial center, but a kind of beacon\u2014a place that promised not just opportunity but a sense of belonging\u2014and that continues to attract wave after wave of ambitious entrepreneurs. But nothing like that exists yet for the industries of the future, where the most interesting and important innovations are taking place with greater geographic spread than we see with Internet-based innovation.\nThere are early geographic leaders in each of the fields, but it is still far too early to describe any of these as the winners or losers in the competition to be home to the next generation of innovation. And what concentration there is today is not destined to be permanent.\nIn the current landscape, the most important work in the commercialization of genomics is clustered around universities where much of the original research and development took place. It is in and around Boston because of Harvard and MIT, Baltimore because of Johns Hopkins, and Silicon Valley because of Stanford and the Universities of California in San Francisco and Berkeley. Walking through the offices of these companies, one can\u2019t help but notice how diverse the workforces are. European, Asian, African, and South American employees fill these companies and live in Boston, Baltimore, or California because they all studied at American universities.\nThe other major prong of genetics research is in China. Though it does not have a top university program in genetics, China has done an excellent job recruiting its citizens back home after they have studied abroad. As a result, Beijing is quickly becoming a center of domain expertise in genomics. In cyber, the most interesting companies are often based proximate to government, where domain expertise was developed inside the best law enforcement and intelligence communities, including Washington, D.C., Tel Aviv, London, and Moscow. Europe\u2019s first cybersecurity accelerator, CyLon, was cofounded by two top foreign policy aides to British prime ministers. One of the world\u2019s largest cybersecurity companies, Kaspersky Lab, is full of former Russian military and intelligence officers.\nIsrael has many of the best cybersecurity firms, founded by people who got their start in cyber in the Israeli Defense Forces, especially Unit 8200, Yehida Shmoneh-Matayim, the intelligence corps focused on signals intelligence.\nIn robotics, domain expertise and the early commercial leadership is generally concentrated where there is preexisting domain expertise in electronics and advanced manufacturing\u2014in countries like Japan, South Korea, and Germany. Yet even as the industries of the future offer new opportunities to rising hotbeds of innovation around the world, it\u2019s interesting to watch how Silicon Valley\u2019s influence lingers and continues to draw start-ups in almost every industry. Consider the example of digital currency and fintech, industries of the future that blend old world and new.\nNew York and London are the world\u2019s two dominant centers of domain expertise in global banking today, and both are home to substantial fintech investment. Over the past five years, the United Kingdom and Ireland were home to 52 percent of all the fintech financing in Europe. And New York drew even larger levels of fintech financing than London, with dozens of deals putting hundreds of millions of dollars into the bank accounts of technology companies trying to make the banking sector smarter.\nBut when Zac Townsend wanted to start a company focused on smartening up the banking industry, he did not start it in London or New York. He started it in California. It mattered less to Zac that expertise in banking specifically was in New York or London than that the expertise in innovation and its supporting culture was in California. He believed that in order to change the banking system, he had to work with it but away from it\u2014an approach that is also reflected in the broader data.\nAlthough New York and London are the global centers for banking, they are respectively second and third in fintech financing behind Silicon Valley, which gets about one-third of all the investments that take place in the fintech space. This raises an interesting question about just how distributed the industries of the future are going to be.\nSilicon Valley: the next Roman empire?\nWhen twentysomethings like Zac decide to start a company and determine that in order to do so they need to be in California, it creates a self-perpetuating cycle. More broadly, Zac\u2019s decision to base his new data-driven finance company in Silicon Valley reflects a roiling debate over just how domain expertise will develop in the big data industry and what effect this is going to have on the global economy as a whole. With the major impact that big data is having on almost every industry, the way that big data expertise develops has the potential to change the very nature of business. And investors are placing big bets on two very different answers.\nWill big data serve to centralize businesses, pulling more industries into the gravitational field of Silicon Valley? Or will it allow more businesses to innovate wherever they are, in effect creating more opportunities in more places around the world than has been possible before now?\nOn one side of the argument is Charlie Songhurst, who sees the Valley as a burgeoning global empire. Because of Silicon Valley, Charlie says, \u201cGlobal regional inequality is going to be unlike anything we\u2019ve ever seen except maybe the comparative power of Rome versus the rest of the ancient world.\u201d While I think Charlie overstates things, he makes an argument that\u2019s worth examining.\nHis thesis lines up with a number of other thinkers who believe that Silicon Valley\u2019s expertise in software and analytics will swallow up entire industries and cause massive centralization. The founders of Uber had no particular expertise in transportation, but that did not matter because of their ability to build a software and analytics platform. The idea that underlies Songhurst\u2019s vision is that Silicon Valley companies could eventually run everything in which software and big data are useful\u2014which is basically every industry on the planet. So what\u2019s going to happen in this new data-driven empire, according to Charlie? \u201cIt\u2019s a very simple equation,\u201d he says. \u201cCountries with high education and low wages will export IQ. That will be the Baltics, India, China. Of course, it\u2019s terrible if you\u2019re in Ohio or England or France or someone competing with an Estonian. So what you\u2019ll get is a massive mean reversion of income throughout the world where the Valley, Israel, China, and maybe a couple of other places get very high economic returns and everywhere else in the world starts to revert to the mean. Again, it starts to look more like the Roman Empire.\u201d\nIt is also the case that while the powers that be in Silicon Valley might not be the earliest movers in fields like precision agriculture, once success is achieved elsewhere, they don\u2019t just sit back as passive bystanders and watch it grow. Google chairman Eric Schmidt recruited an Israeli entrepreneur, Dror Berman, to move to Silicon Valley and head up Innovation Endeavors, a large venture firm that invests Schmidt\u2019s money. Israel is home to many of the 20th century\u2019s great innovations in farming. Berman brought the intellectual curiosity about agriculture with him to Silicon Valley and developed Farm2050, a partnership that aspires to combine data science and robotics to improve farming with a group of partners as diverse as Google, DuPont, and 3D Robotics.\nDror recognized that Silicon Valley can be a little too navel-gazing, and told me that 90 percent of the region\u2019s entrepreneurs focus on 10 percent of the world\u2019s problems. With Farm2050, he is trying to bring Silicon Valley\u2019s A game to agriculture. Silicon Valley\u2019s history as a home to apricot and plum orchards is long past, and if it does establish itself as the source of winning investment or innovation for precision agriculture, it will contradict the idea that domain expertise will drive the industries of the future. Instead, it would suggest, as futurist Jaron Lanier has argued in his book Who Owns the Future?, that those who hold the most data, the fastest servers, and the most processing power will drive all growth from here on out.\nIt\u2019s basically the idea that Google could do my job and your job\u2014 and everyone else\u2019s job\u2014better if they wanted to simply by applying their top-of-the-line analytics abilities. There is an increasingly large audience, however, that holds a different view from Charlie Songhurst. They believe that big data, instead of absorbing and supplanting other industries, will serve as a broad tool that every existing industry can use to spur growth. The idea is that data will become widely usable and scalable enough that it won\u2019t have domain expertise in the same way that other high-barrier-to-entry industries of the future like genomics or robotics do.\nThis view was explained to me by Mark Gorenberg, a veteran of West Coast venture investing who saw the investment case for analytics early and built a venture capital firm around it, Zetta Venture Partners. Mark has been in venture capital for a quarter-century and splits most of his time among investing, work with MIT, and serving as an advisor to the president of the United States as a member of the President\u2019s Council of Advisors on Science and Technology. Gorenberg believes the big data economy will extend far beyond Silicon Valley.\nHe says: \u201cAnalytics businesses will come from anywhere. You have the algorithmic expertise on one side that is coming out of a lot of universities and you have the domain expertise for particular industries, which manifest themselves everywhere.\u201d Gorenberg argues that as the big data market grows over the next couple of decades, it can be a source of revitalization for old industrial centers where local domain expertise exists.\nIn the rust belt, for example, he sees strong opportunities for the development of analytics firms rooted in the region\u2019s strength managing industrial processes. He sees Boston\u2019s strength as a biotech center enabling it to create health data companies, and he foresees the creation of energy analytics companies in Texas. He predicts that we will see strong privacy and forensics companies forming around Washington, D.C., that build on the capabilities in the law enforcement and intelligence communities, providing high-paying jobs for people who worked at the NSA, CIA, and FBI.\nIf Gorenberg is correct that \u201cdomain expertise is everywhere,\u201d then there is no reason not to be optimistic about the prospects for big data firms developing outside the United States. It just takes a combination of algorithmic expertise and domain expertise.\nFor example, having lost out on the wealth creation built around the Internet, Germany is now determined to leverage its domain expertise in logistics and household appliances to own the analytics markets in those areas of traditional strength, an initiative it calls Industrie 4.0. If the big data market develops as Gorenberg predicts\u2014with the best companies being headquartered all over the world\u2014then wealth creation will look entirely different for big data than it did for the Internet, where the benefits were concentrated in a 30-by-15- mile area.\nI was persuaded by Gorenberg\u2019s view when I was in New Zealand and saw an example of how the combination of big data and domain expertise will determine the geography of the industries of the future. New Zealand is home to twice as many dairy cattle as human beings. The Kiwis know cows.\nWhile there, I learned about the impact of Pasture Meter, a precision-agriculture technology developed in Palmerston, a community of 82,000 people in the Manawatu-Wanganui region of New Zealand\u2019s North Island, more than 10,000 kilometers away from Silicon Valley. Pasture Meter uses advanced sensor technology to take 200 measurements per second over vast swaths of farmland to identify how much grass is in a paddock so that dairy cows can be distributed most effectively for feeding. It alerts farmers to the amount of feed they have and identifies low-production areas that need intervention from the farmer, say, more fertilizer.\nTraditional technology for evaluating fields, like ultrasound or rising plate meters, typically captures only 250 readings of a pasture, whereas Pasture Meter can take up to 18,500 readings. Anyone with a phone can use the technology, and it works regardless of factors like weather.\nIt may seem that monitoring pastures\u2014literally watching the grass grow\u2014is an unnecessary use of real-time analytics, but the Kiwi farmers know better. With the massive increase in upward economic mobility in China, there was increasing demand for beef and dairy products, but New Zealand\u2019s cattle farmers needed higher levels of efficiency\u2014greater scale and lower prices\u2014if they were going to sell into such a large market.\nChina\u2019s population is 288 times the size of New Zealand\u2019s. With strong domain expertise in dairy farming, local farmers and farm-equipment manufacturers knew that if they could feed their cattle more efficiently, that would increase output enough for them to export to China. What happened? Sales of beef from New Zealand to China soared 478 percent in one year. China surpassed New Zealand\u2019s neighbor Australia as New Zealand\u2019s largest export market, more than twice the size of what is exported from New Zealand to the United States.\nThe fact that it surprised me that it could be so important to know the location and concentration of grass in a field is exactly the point: New Zealand\u2019s farmers had the domain expertise, so they knew what needed to be built and they built it. It\u2019s too much to say that Pasture Meter deserves credit for the full 478 percent increase in beef exports, but local farmers bring it up as one of the important factors.\nWhat happened in New Zealand can and will happen in other industries where there may not be a deep history of big data and analytics, but where there is domain expertise in another industry that knows where and how analytics would add value. The big data applications themselves are easily scalable, can be done broadly around the world, and can be implemented whether or not there is much previous data experience\u2014as was the case for the people in Palmerston, New Zealand, who made equipment for the region\u2019s dairy farmers.\nSilicon Valley builds things that Silicon Valley wants, from nicer taxi services to more photo-sharing apps. But investors and entrepreneurs in Silicon Valley don\u2019t see the world through, say, the eyes of farmers. Thus, they are less likely than a company in the Manawatu Wanganui region of New Zealand\u2019s North Island to recognize the need for and develop a technology that enables greater beef and dairy production for export to China. While Marc Andreessen is as closely identified with Silicon Valley as anybody, he agrees that those fields that are early in their development can and should take root wherever there is deep knowledge about a specific area.\nHe has proposed that Detroit leverage its expertise in automotive mechanics to become \u201cDrone Valley,\u201d and suggests that rather than trying to create more Silicon Valleys, we should hope and plan for the creation of \u201c50 different variations of Silicon Valley, all unique from each other and all focusing on different domains.\u201d\nLarry Summers reinforced Andreessen\u2019s view, telling me, \u201cMy general line is, in essence, there is much more division of labor than there used to be. Strategies for countries, companies, and people are much more about building on your strength than offsetting your weaknesses than it used to be.\u201d\nThis effectively means to stop trying to chase after Silicon Valley and focus on the skills and processes that will unleash the next wave of innovation in fields in which there is already local expertise. My view is that the geographic spread of domain expertise in the industries of the future will ensure that the next stage of globalization produces centers of innovation and commercialization that are more geographically diverse than the last stage, when Silicon Valley enjoyed 20 years of domination.\nThere won\u2019t be a Roman Empire. The thought that software and big data\u2013savvy companies and entrepreneurs in Silicon Valley will reign supreme is not a crazy one, but I think that as big data becomes more widely adopted, it will be more of a commodity that any industry can use. There is a real opportunity for stakeholders with domain expertise to innovate for themselves, and in breathtaking ways.\nBut if they wait too long, some 28-year-olds in California are going to do it instead.\nIn the cases where an industry is too slow to adapt, then eventually more efficient, less expert start-ups (with big data expertise) like Uber will step in and take down companies with decades of domain expertise.\nIn the famous words of H. G. Wells, \u201cAdapt or perish.\u201d\nAlec Ross is the author of The Industries of the Future, to be released next week by Simon & Schuster.

Their answers?", "body": "During two years of intense research for the writing The Industries of the Future, my interviews with dozens of the world\u2019s most successful, powerful people often turned to parenting. We\u2019ve heard people like Carlos Slim, Eric Schmidt and Larry Summers talk about business or the economy, but talking to them about what skills and attributes today\u2019s children will need to compete and succeed in tomorrow\u2019s economy always got them far away from talking points. \nWhile I dedicate an entire chapter to the topic of parenting in The Industries of the Future, I did want to briefly share some common themes that emerged from my research.\n1. Make sure your kids are learning languages, foreign languages as well as a technical, programming, or scientific language. If big data, genomics, cyber, and robotics/AI are among the high-growth industries of the future, then the people who will make their livings in those industries need to be fluent in the coding languages behind them. Coding also teaches children a way to think and solve problems that is still valuable even if the computer programming language changes.\nSimilarly, as the economy grows more global, cultural fluency and the ability to communicate in more than just one language will grow even more important than they are today.\n2. Demand more academic enrichment out of your children\u2019s schools, but don\u2019t rely on them. My mother was nicknamed Becky the Barbarian in part because she was a relentless advocate for her children\u2019s education at school and at home. I did not appreciate it at the time, but that is what enabled a public school kid from West Virginia who had to work as a midnight janitor to achieve the success I have since had in business, government and academia.\nThe business leaders I spoke with suggested we all needed to follow the Becky the Barbarian model. Hold others to account but also hold yourself to account. Do something about it if your school isn\u2019t offering a rigorous education that meets your child\u2019s needs, but also do something about it if the hours after school for your children are spent unproductively. If your child\u2019s school does not teach them a foreign language, computer programming or challenging enough math, there are enough free resources online that you don\u2019t have an excuse as a parent to keep that from your children.\n3. Ingrain your children with a commitment to lifelong learning. The idea that education ends with an undergraduate or graduate university degree is an anachronism. That MBA or masters in electrical engineering that is so difficult to earn will be near-useless 15 years after graduation if there isn\u2019t a commitment to continuing to learn. The pace of change in business has quickened over the past 10 years and is only going to accelerate further. It\u2019s not the strongest who survive, or the most intelligent, but those most adaptable to change. Lifelong learners are the more resilient than anybody else in times of change.\nI\u2019ll conclude by stating the obvious: these three things are not meant to be comprehensive, nor do they account for social, emotional and spiritual development. But in discussions with many of the world\u2019s most successful people in business, these stand-out. Please share what you think are the key attributes today\u2019s children will need to be successful in tomorrow\u2019s economy!\nAlec Ross is the author of The Industries of the Future, to be released in February by Simon & Schuster."}, {"author": "Alec Ross", "headline": "China has a decision to make in 2016, and it's one that matters for the global economy", "body": "It\u2019s a rainy, smoggy day here in Shanghai\u2019s Pudong District.

On the positive side, the reforms it announced last year allowing for more truth in the value of its currency and interest rates were responsible steps forward. The crackdown against corruption continues, too. Among those who reportedly have been detained in the last few weeks are the chairman of China\u2019s largest private conglomerate and the head of one of its largest fashion companies, estimated to be China\u2019s 34th and 65th richest citizens respectively (by way of companies, Forbes estimates Elon Musk and Eli Broad to be America\u2019s 34th and 65th richest).\nOn the negative side, there are abundant other examples that China is reasserting its control-freak impulses. Last week, the Chinese central bank temporarily suspended certain foreign banks from conducting foreign exchange transactions.\nThe impulse for control continues to reach from central markets to deep into peoples\u2019 personal lives.

If it opens up, it will position itself to better compete in the industries of the future. The devaluation of its currency and unwinding of its old systems will cause short-term economic distress, but it will be worth it.

STOCKHOLM \nStockholm, Sweden is a lot more than Spotify. It is now the second largest producer of billion dollar start-ups after Silicon Valley on a per capita basis. The thing that stands out about young Swedish companies is the diversity. They\u2019re producing winners in fields as varied as telecommunications, gaming and the Internet of Things. The entrepreneurs and engineers from all over Sweden (with just 9.5 million people) converge on stylish Stockholm when it comes time to start a company.\nWhile I was in government, I noticed that Sweden\u2019s security-focused computer scientists are some of the best in the world. With people becoming ever-more focused on privacy and security, I expect the some of the high-end research and development being done by Swedish engineers to be commercialized in 2016 and find a market almost immediately.  \n2. CAMBRIDGE (NOT MASSACHUSETTS!) \nCambridge, Massachusetts has long been home to start-ups with intellectual roots at MIT and Harvard. It\u2019s now the university town north of London that has the start-up scene that is ready to achieve altitude. Its \u201cSilicon Fen\u201d has been around for some time, producing modest successes. Some of its analytics and biotech companies are among the most exciting in the world. \nThe best indication to me that the UK\u2019s Cambridge was ready to enter the first tier came from hearing the same thing on more than one phone call with world-leading investors. \nMe: Where are you calling from?\nBig Investor: Um, Cambridge University.\nMe: Nice! What are you doing up there?\nBig Investor: Well, uh, just talking to a couple companies.\n3. SEOUL \nSouth Korea is far-better known for its big electronics and automotive companies than it is for its start-ups, but that could soon change given the new maturity of a start-up scene in Seoul many years in the making.\nThe South Korean government is trying to tailor its regulatory environment to be as entrepreneur-friendly as possible. This includes $3.7 billion of spending by government in its start-ups.\nIts aggressive M&A environment allows for entrepreneurs and investors to achieve liquidity more easily than most other Asian markets and allows successful company founders to start that next company. \nMost important is a change in mindset. Following decades of military dictatorship, the safety of a traditional job in a big company was appealing to most Koreans. \u201cStability\u201d was valued above all else. South Koreans who have grown up in its vibrant democracy and always on youth-culture (to be young and Korean is to be LTE-connected) have an entrepreneurial mindset that is more like their peers across the ocean in California than that of their parents.\n4. MARYLAND \nOkay, I\u2019m cheating on this one. I live in Baltimore so my bias to what\u2019s happening in Maryland could stem from it not requiring time on an airplane. Here\u2019s the thing: Maryland is smack-dab in the middle of two fields that are going to see massive investment and commercialization in 2016: security and genomics. \nTo live in Maryland is to live shoulder-to-shoulder with some of the world\u2019s best mathematicians and computer scientists who work at the NSA, CIA or Beltway contractors that sell to government. More and more of these are abandoning the pension and anonymity lifestyle of career government service to start or join start-ups that are bringing individuals and enterprises intelligence-sector-grade cyber security. The NSA\u2019s cafeteria would be chock-a-block with VCs and headhunters, if only they were allowed on campus. \nMaryland is also home to what might be a better bet for 2017 than 2016: the commercialization of genomics. Billions of dollars of R&D $ flow into projects at the National Institutes of Health and Johns Hopkins University to turn our genetic data into \u201cPrecision Medicines\u201d that can tailor therapies to our genetic make-up. 15 years after the mapping of the human genome, we are almost to the point of mainstreaming Precision Medicines and when that happens, a lot of the innovation will come from scientist-rich Maryland.\nAlec Ross is the author of The Industries of the Future, to be released in February by Simon & Schuster."}, {"author": "Alec Ross", "headline": "Big banks once laughed at Bitcoin.

An early signal that Bitcoin would be hard-pressed to gain mainstream acceptance came in the form of mudballs that were thrown at it from Wall Street. JP Morgan CEO Jamie Dimon made a comment representative of the sentiment of many of his peers when he said, \u201cthe question isn\u2019t whether we accept it. The question is, do we even participate in people who facilitate Bitcoin.\u201d\nFast forward a few years and Wall Street has discovered that the blockchain technology enabling Bitcoin could save the industry tens of billions a year, so instead of throwing mudballs, they\u2019re now figuring out how to use the technology behind Bitcoin. \nI\u2019ve had two conversations with Goldman Sachs CEO Lloyd Blankfein about Bitcoin. In the first, back in 2013, he sort of sneered. In the second conversation, last year, he half-smiled and said, \u201cwe\u2019re looking at its technology.\u201d \nAt its most basic, a blockchain is a distributed database, a sort of ledger, that is protected with encryption and which allows the transfer of goods and services without middlemen. There are a lot of middlemen in the business of transferring payments.\nEarlier this week, Goldman Sachs filed a patent application for a new virtual currency it calls \u201cSETLcoin\u201d which uses blockchain technology.\nWith SETLcoin, Goldman Sachs imagines instantaneous execution and settlement \u201cfor exchanging assets, such as securities (e.g., stocks, bonds, etc.) cash, and/or cash equivalents via a peer-to-peer network\u201d according to it patent filing, wiping out the costs associated with these types of asset exchanges. \nGoldman isn\u2019t going to start doing business in Bitcoin instead of the dollar, euro or renminbi; it\u2019s taking lessons from Bitcoin and using the blockchain as the computer science protocol for its own cryptocurrency.\nIn the same way HTML became the protocol markup language for the World Wide Web, the blockchain may have the technological ingenuity to become the protocol for transactions where there is a need for a high level of trust.\nI expect Goldman Sachs to do away with one of Bitcoin\u2019s defining features: pseudo-anonymity. By using real names and identities on SETLcoin, Goldman Sachs would near-eliminate the kind of fraud and misuse that has plagued Bitcoin. \nThe cypherpunks and cryptolibertarians behind Bitcoin\u2019s creation and early adoption must be pulling their hair out. Bitcoin was created in the wake of the financial crisis to provide anonymous financial tools as an alternative to the dominant banking system. For Wall Street to now adopt its blockchain technology is deeply ironic and will probably become very, very profitable.\nAlec Ross is the author of The Industries of the Future, to be released in February by Simon & Schuster."}, {"author": "Alec Ross", "headline": "There's a Thanksgiving history lesson we often forget \u2014 but that's never been more relevant", "body": "Happy Thanksgiving! \nIn 1621, a hungry group of migrants who came to America for religious freedom the year before shared a meal with Native Americans from the Wampanoag tribe to give thanks for the pilgrims\u2019 first harvest, after arriving a year earlier with little to eat, too late in the season to grow crops. \nNearly 400 years later, families around the United States including my own will recreate that meal and give thanks for the blessings that life has given us. \nOn this Thanksgiving, I wanted to give thanks that a grandson of immigrants from Italy, Poland, Germany, England and Ukraine lives in a country where I have been able to grow successful and comfortable. \nI had to work for it. When I began my career, it was doing jobs like working as midnight janitor and delivering heavy kegs of beer in rural West Virginia working on a beer truck. Still, unlike many people beginning their careers in most places in the world, my country\u2019s politics and economics gave me a close-to-fair shot at becoming successful. It did not matter that I was the grandchild of migrants. \nIt\u2019s worth mentioning that among the developments for which I\u2019m thankful are tools like LinkedIn that allow people to connect in ways that were unimaginable 10 years ago. When I got that job on a beer truck, it was because the owner of the beer distributorship and my grandfather were both the sons of Italian immigrants, and that personal tie got me a job that I otherwise would not have gotten. \nTools like LinkedIn are creating more open marketplaces for work, and making labor less rooted in biology (who is your dad?) or sociology (which country club do you belong to?). Biology and sociology still matter, but the openness fostered by today\u2019s technology platforms make biology and sociology a little less deterministic. \nI hope that Americans gathered around the Thanksgiving dinner table remember that unless you are part of the less than 1% of Native Americans who make up our population today, that you are a descendent of immigrants. And while you, too, might have grown successful or (relatively) comfortable, there are many people in the world who need demonstrations of compassion like what the Wampanoag showed the pilgrims, teaching them how to farm and hunt in the new world. For hundreds of years, America has been made itself home to waves of migrants from England to Germany, Poland, Ireland, Italy, China, Vietnam, Cambodia, Mexico and dozens of other countries around the world who have fled poverty or political oppression. Your ancestors did not come to the United States if they were prospering in their homeland.\nAs we give thanks on Thanksgiving, let\u2019s remember from whence we come.\nAlec Ross is the author of The Industries of the Future, to be released in February by Simon & Schuster."}][{"author": "Ryan Holiday", "headline": "An ancient guide to solving all work problems once and for all", "body": "The image of the Zen philosopher is the monk up in the green, quiet hills, or in a beautiful temple on some rocky cliff. The Stoic, on the other hand, is the antithesis of this idea. The Stoic is the man in the marketplace, the merchant on a voyage, the senator in the Forum, the soldier at the front. In other words, they are like you.\nThose jobs might not seem like one well-suited for \u201cphilosophy,\u201d but they are. And so are you. For in even the most modern seeming professions, a Stoic is able to peace and clarity. For thousands of years, Stoicism has been a tool for the ordinary and the elite alive\u2014from slaves to emperors\u2014as they sought wisdom, strength and the \u2018good life.\u2019 It was philosophy designed for action--for doers--not for the classroom.\nWhich is why it has been popular with everyone from Marcus Aurelius and Seneca (one of the richest men in Rome), to Theodore Roosevelt, Frederick the Great and Michel de Montaigne. More recently, Stoicism has been cited by investors like Tim Ferriss and executives like Jonathan Newhouse, the CEO of Cond\u00e9 Nast International. Even football coaches like Pete Carroll of the Seattle Seahawks and baseball managers like Jeff Banister of the Texas Rangers have recommended Stoicism to their players.\nHow can we follow in their timeless footsteps? How can we reap the benefits of this operating system in our own workplace? It\u2019s simple. Go to straight to the sources. Below are Stoic exercises and strategies, pulled from the new book The Daily Stoic (and daily email at DailyStoic.com), that will help you navigate your workplace with better clarity, effectiveness, and peace of mind.\nDON\u2019T MAKE THINGS HARDER THAN THEY NEED TO BE\n\u201cIf someone asks you how to write your name, would you bark out each letter? And if they get angry, would you then return the anger? Wouldn\u2019t you rather gently spell out each letter for them? So then, remember in life that your duties are the sum of individual acts. Pay attention to each of these as you do your duty . . . just methodically complete your task.\u201d\u2014Marcus Aurelius, Meditations, 6.26\nHere\u2019s a common scenario. You\u2019re working with a frustrating coworker or a difficult boss. They ask you to do something and, because you dislike the messenger, you immediately object. There\u2019s this problem or that one, or their request is obnoxious and rude. So you tell them, \u201cNo, I\u2019m not going to do it.\u201d Then they retaliate by not doing something that you had previously asked of them. And so the conflict escalates.\nMeanwhile, if you could step back and see it objectively, you\u2019d probably see that not everything they\u2019re asking for is unreasonable. In fact, some of it is pretty easy to do or is, at least, agreeable. And if you did it, it might make the rest of the tasks a bit more tolerable too. Pretty soon, you\u2019ve done the entire thing.\nLife (and our job) is difficult enough. Let\u2019s not make it harder by getting emotional about insignificant matters or digging in for battles we don\u2019t actually care about. Let\u2019s not let emotion get in the way of kathe\u0302kon, the simple, appropriate actions on the path to virtue.\nIMPOSSIBLE WITHOUT YOUR CONSENT\n\u201cToday I escaped from the crush of circumstances, or better put, I threw them out, for the crush wasn\u2019t from outside me but in my own assumptions.\u201d\u2014Marcus Aurelius, Meditations, 9.13\nOn tough days we might say, \u201cMy work is overwhelming,\u201d or \u201cMy boss is really frustrating.\u201d If only we could understand that this is impossible. Someone can\u2019t frustrate you, work can\u2019t overwhelm you-these are external objects, and they have no access to your mind. Those emotions you feel, as real as they are, come from the inside, not the outside.\nThe Stoics use the word hypole\u0302psis, which means \u201ctaking up\u201d\u2014of perceptions, thoughts, and judgments by our mind. What we assume, what we willingly generate in our mind, that\u2019s on us. We can\u2019t blame other people for making us feel stressed or frustrated any more than we can blame them for our jealousy. The cause is within us. They\u2019re just the target.\nA PROPER FRAME OF MIND\n\u201cFrame your thoughts like this\u2014you are an old person, you won\u2019t let yourself be enslaved by this any longer, no longer pulled like a puppet by every impulse, and you\u2019ll stop complaining about your present fortune or dreading the future.\u201d \u2014Marcus Aurelius, Meditations, 2.2\nWe resent the person who comes in and tries to boss us around. Don\u2019t tell me how to dress, how to think, how to do my job, how to live. This is because we are independent, self-sufficient people.\nOr at least that\u2019s what we tell ourselves.\nYet if someone says something we disagree with, something inside us tells us we have to argue with them. If there\u2019s a plate of cookies in front of us, we have to eat them. If someone does something we dislike, we have to get mad about it. When something bad happens, we have to be sad, depressed, or worried. But if something good happens a few minutes later, all of a sudden we\u2019re happy, excited, and want more.\nWe would never let another person jerk us around the way we let our impulses do. It\u2019s time we start seeing it that way\u2014that we\u2019re not puppets that can be made to dance this way or that way just because we feel like it. We should be the ones in control, not our emotions, because we are independent, self-sufficient people.\nKEEP IT SIMPLE\n\u201cAt every moment keep a sturdy mind on the task at hand, as a Roman and human being, doing it with strict and simple dignity, affection, freedom, and justice\u2014giving yourself a break from all other considerations. You can do this if you approach each task as if it is your last, giving up every distraction, emotional subversion of reason, and all drama, vanity, and complaint over your fair share. You can see how mastery over a few things makes it possible to live an abundant and devout life\u2014for, if you keep watch over these things, the gods won\u2019t ask for more.\u201d \u2014 Marcus Aurelius, Meditations, 2.5\nEach day presents the chance to overthink things. What should I wear? Do they like me? Am I eating well enough? What\u2019s next for me in life? Is my boss happy with my work?\nToday, let\u2019s focus just on what\u2019s in front of us. We\u2019ll follow the dictum that New England Patriots coach Bill Belichick gives his players: \u201cDo your job.\u201d Like a Roman, like a good soldier, like a master of our craft. We don\u2019t need to get lost in a thousand other distractions or in other people\u2019s business.\nMarcus says to approach each task as if it were your last, because it very well could be. And even if it isn\u2019t, botching what\u2019s right in front of you doesn\u2019t help anything. Find clarity in the simplicity of doing.\nNEVER DO ANYTHING OUT OF HABIT\n\u201cSo in the majority of other things, we address circumstances not in accordance with the right assumptions, but mostly by following wretched habit. Since all that I\u2019ve said is the case, the person in training must seek to rise above, so as to stop seeking out pleasure and steering away from pain; to stop clinging to living and abhorring death; and in the case of property and money, to stop valuing receiving over giving.\u201d\u2014Musonius Rufus, Lectures, 6.25.5\u201311                                   \nA worker is asked: \u201cWhy did you do it this way?\u201d The answer, \u201cBecause that\u2019s the way we\u2019ve always done things.\u201d The answer frustrates every good boss and sets the mouth of every entrepreneur watering. The worker has stopped thinking and is mindlessly operating out of habit. The business is ripe for disruption by a competitor, and the worker will probably get fired by any thinking boss.\nWe should apply the same ruthlessness to our own habits. In fact, we are studying philosophy precisely to break ourselves of rote behavior. Find what you do out of rote memory or routine. Ask yourself: Is this really the best way to do it? Know why you do what you do\u2014do it for the right reasons.                                                            \nYOUR CAREER IS NOT A LIFE SENTENCE\n\u201cHow disgraceful is the lawyer whose dying breath passes while at court, at an advanced age, pleading for unknown litigants and still seeking the approval of ignorant spectators.\u201d\u2014Seneca, On the Brevity of Life, 20.2\nEvery few years, a sad spectacle is played out in the news. An old millionaire, still lord of his business empire, is taken to court. Shareholders and family members go to court to argue that he is no longer mentally competent to make decisions\u2014that the patriarch is not fit to run his own company and legal affairs. Because this powerful person refused to ever relinquish control or develop a succession plan, he is subjected to one of life\u2019s worst humiliations: the public exposure of his most private vulnerabilities.\nWe must not get so wrapped up in our work that we think we\u2019re immune from the reality of aging and life. Who wants to be the person who can never let go? Is there so little meaning in your life that your only pursuit is work until you\u2019re eventually carted off in a coffin?\nTake pride in your work. But it is not all.                                                            \nPROTECT YOUR PEACE OF MIND\n\u201cKeep constant guard over your perceptions, for it is no small thing you are protecting, but your respect, trustworthiness and steadi- ness, peace of mind, freedom from pain and fear, in a word your freedom. For what would you sell these things?\u201d\u2014Epictetus, Discourses, 4.3.6b\u20138\nThe dysfunctional job that stresses you out, a contentious relationship, life in the spotlight. Stoicism, because it helps us manage and think through our emotional reactions, can make these kinds of situations easier to bear. It can help you manage and mitigate the triggers that seem to be so constantly tripped.\nBut here\u2019s a question: Why are you subjecting yourself to this? Is this really the environment you were made for? To be provoked by nasty emails and an endless parade of workplace problems? Our adrenal glands can handle only so much before they become exhausted. Shouldn\u2019t you preserve them for life-and-death situations?\nSo yes, use Stoicism to manage these difficulties. But don\u2019t forget to ask: Is this really the life I want? Every time you get upset, a little bit of life leaves the body. Are these really the things on which you want to spend that priceless resource? Don\u2019t be afraid to make a change\u2014a big one.\nRyan Holiday is the bestselling author of The Obstacle Is the Wayand Ego is the Enemy, whose forthcoming book, The Daily Stoic: 366 Meditations on Wisdom, Perseverance, and the Art of Living, will be released on October 18.

Editorial decided it would no longer accept columns of this nature on this topic. I have the utmost respect for the leadership at the Observer, but I respectfully disagree with that decision. Anyone who would like to republish the article is welcome to.\nDad, let me start this letter by saying that it isn\u2019t my intention to embarrass you. I find that I can express myself in writing better than I can when we talk on the phone (in fact, if anyone likes this piece, that will be, in its own way, a compliment to you\u2014I developed as a writer sitting alone in my room as a kid, trying to find ways to respond to your overwhelming parental logic) and so when I heard that you were leaning towards voting for Donald Trump, I felt inclined to put my thoughts down so they would be clear.\nIt's fitting that I would write to you here anyway, because the Observer has its own father issues when it comes to Donald Trump (Mr. Trump is the publisher\u2019s father-in-law.) This is a newspaper that, despite its sincere and passionate reporting on anti-Semitism and its frontline investigations on the rise of Russia as a national security threat, has found itself endorsing and defending Trump...even as he veers dangerously towards courting anti-Semitism and justifying Russia\u2019s authoritarian methods (when he isn\u2019t complimenting the tactics of Saddam Hussein.) Having been associated with my own fair share of controversial people, I empathize with the position, Jared Kushner, the paper\u2019s owner, must be in.\nI get that elections are complicated. Yet I cannot help but feel that the right choice has become increasingly simple. Not easy, but simple.\nThe choice is simple because it\u2019s hard for me to think of a single person who violates more of what you taught me as a child. The case against Donald Trump as a candidate\u2014even as a person worthy of two seconds of anyone\u2019s serious attention in our busy lives\u2014is clear to me precisely because of what I learned from you, Dad.\nI remember the trips we took to Angel Island in the San Francisco Bay. This is where people like Grandma and Grandpa first arrived in America, you told us. It was here that they stopped on their way to the American Dream, fleeing the terror of their homeland and hoping for a better life. You taught us that it was honorable and brave to be an immigrant and that what made America special was that we opened our arms to these people. Do you remember taking us to the Civil War battlefields and explaining how many of the men who fought and died in that war were fresh off the boat, paying for their citizenship to this country in blood\u2014dying to eradicate the scourge of slavery, a plague they had nothing to do with creating in the first place? That was what made America great, you said.\nBut you didn\u2019t just teach us to admire white European immigrants either. It was from you that I learned to respect just how hard Latino, Asian, and Middle Eastern immigrants worked to make a life for themselves here. You told me what it was like picking fruit in the California heat, and explained how they took jobs that other people weren\u2019t willing to do\u2014because they wanted to support their families just like everyone else. You also took the time to explain how many immigrants were entrepreneurs\u2014starting restaurants and small businesses from donut shops to car dealerships (we\u2019ve invested together in a few of those small businesses) and how their efforts made the world better for everyone.\nWhen I was in Austria a few years ago, I called Mom and had her do some research to find the location of the refugee camp that Grandpa was sent to when he was just a little younger than I am now. It\u2019s an apartment complex now, which I guess goes to show how quickly we can forget the kind of thinking that creates such horrors. Experiences like these\u2014they color the way I see the world, which is why, I imagine, you encouraged us to travel and study history. Those trips are why I find it so repulsive to hear Donald Trump talk about how Mexicans are \u201crapists\u201d and how his solution is building a literal wall\u2014 \u201cWe\u2019re going to have a big, beautiful wall that nobody\u2019s crossing\u201d\u2014to keep these kinds of people out. I find it disgusting to hear him talk about banning Muslims from America. That\u2019s not what you taught me. That\u2019s not how this country is supposed to work. Mom and half our relatives wouldn\u2019t be here if it was.\nI told you that a few weeks ago we had someone out at the house to repair some damage from the floods. As I was walking the property with the guy, he asked me if I owned a gun. I said that I did\u2014this is Texas after all. \u201cGood,\u201d he said, \u201cyou\u2019ll need to have something when them sand niggers come and try to take this country from us.\u201d Then he told me about how he was glad Donald Trump was speaking the truth and taking things in the right direction.\nI know you don\u2019t agree with this man. And I don\u2019t think it\u2019s fair to hold a candidate accountable for every fringe group that attaches themselves to their platform. But doesn\u2019t it alarm you to see a candidate who seems to stoke these kinds of fires\u2014directly or indirectly? Surely you must be shaking your head at Trump\u2019s repeated refusal to distance himself from these people.\nAs a police officer, you worked for a time in the hate crimes division. You\u2019ve seen the horrible things that prejudice and ignorance can do. I remember you once told me that the way the Ku Klux Klan recruited people in our hometown was by convincing white people that they were being attacked and that their way of life was under siege. C\u2019mon Dad, is that not eerily similar to some of Trump\u2019s campaign tactics? Why else would he have refused to immediately disavow the support of David Duke and other white supremacists? What possible purpose did he have to insinuate that President Obama was a Muslim, that he was not born in America? Or question a Mexican-American judge\u2019s loyalty to the law and to the Constitution?\nA few years ago, Donald Trump went on live television and talked about nice his daughter Ivanka\u2019s body was, saying how if he wasn\u2019t her father, he\u2019d probably be dating her. It was disturbing then, but we all say things that come off utterly differently than intended. Except last year, speaking to a Rolling Stone reporter, Trump said the exact same thing again. \u201cYeah, she's really something, and what a beauty, that one,\u201d he told the journalist. \u201cIf I weren't happily married and, ya know, her father...\u201d\nYou have a daughter (and now a daughter-in-law). Can you imagine saying anything like that about them? What would you say to one of your friends who uttered something half that creepy? You\u2019ve been married for thirty years. You taught me about respecting women, about the importance of marriage and fidelity. This man, he doesn\u2019t stand for any of that. On the contrary, he refers to women he doesn\u2019t like as \u201cfat pigs\u201d and \u201cdogs.\u201d He attacks them and when they press him on the issues, says it\u2019s because they\u2019re probably menstruating.\nYou\u2019ve protected presidents and other heads of state as part of your job. Can you imagine any of them behaving that way? I remember our family trip to the White House in middle school\u2014even though you disagreed with the man who was President, you spoke of the office with such reverence and dignity that we felt honored just to visit. I left that day with exactly the sense of admiration and respect for the office that I think you hoped we\u2019d feel. I remember another trip to New York where we walked by the Trump Tower. What\u2019s that, I asked? You just shook your head and said, \u201cTacky.\u201d\nBefore he died, Grandad gave me his copy of John McCain\u2019s memoir Faith of My Fathers and said that I might like to read it. It wasn\u2019t until years later that I got around to it. Did you know that when John McCain was trapped in that horrible North Vietnamese prison, his captors offered to let him go several times? McCain\u2019s father was the commander of all US forces in the Vietnam theater and the Vietcong thought by giving his son an easy way out, they could show that Americans were cowards. Despite the repeated torture that he\u2019d already undergone, despite the fact that McCain ached to go home, he refused. He stayed because he refused to embarrass his country or abandon his comrades\u2014death was better than dishonor. I think that\u2019s the kind of lesson that Grandad was trying to pass along to me. I know you voted for McCain in 2000 and in 2008 in part for that very reason. I don\u2019t agree with many of McCain\u2019s politics but I hope that when tested, I could exhibit one iota of the courage that that man has.\nAnd yet here we are discussing a Republican candidate who insulted John McCain in front of the entire world\u2014claiming that John McCain isn\u2019t a hero because he was captured and spent time in a POW camp. Donald Trump, who got out of serving with a series of draft deferments, said he only likes the veterans \u201cthat weren\u2019t captured.\u201d That this pathetic encounter has been nearly forgotten in the campaign is not because Donald addressed it or apologized, but rather because nearly every day since he either said something worse or piled on with some other obscene gesture or gaffe.\nWouldn\u2019t just a single one of these remarks have run a candidate out of the race in a normal election cycle? Wouldn\u2019t have these repeated and ridiculous lapses in judgement effectively end the campaign for anyone in any election anywhere in the civilized world? I\u2019ve tried to think about why we\u2019ve been so forgiving of Donald Trump. Is it because his opponent is a woman? Does it say something about us? Have we all collectively lost our sense of where the line is and we\u2019re just hoping that someone will finally draw it for us?\nI realize that most of these issues I\u2019ve brought up are personal ones, but isn\u2019t all politics personal? That\u2019s a lesson I learned from you, too. I remember asking whether you supported the Republican or the Democrat candidate in some local election when I was a kid, having heard some friends\u2019 parents talking about it. You told me that people got too caught up in party affiliation and that what really mattered was character and whether you could work together with the person (and whether they could do the job). That\u2019s how I\u2019ve tried to think all my life. I\u2019m thinking about it now that it really matters.\nThe baffling reality is that when it comes to Trump, it\u2019s difficult to critique him on much besides his personality and (lack of) character\u2014because that is all there is. Maybe you can make an exception for some of these comments, I\u2019ve certainly said dumb things before. We all have. Maybe we chalk them up to media mischaracterizations as some of the Trump supporters I know have (given what I write about in this column, I\u2019m the last one to think the media is completely fair or trustworthy). But even making allowances for that, I know for a fact, no matter what the talking heads on TV are trying to tell moderate conservatives, is that you and he stand very far apart on most of the economic principles and civil policies in which you have always believed.\nI remember long trips in the car and the conversation we had about civics and governance. The basics you taught me about the free market, about capitalism, about the government staying out of people\u2019s business. Now that I\u2019m an adult, I\u2019ve come to fully understand and truly appreciate why you taught me these lessons. I see how they\u2019ve contributed to my own success. I also see how the few policies or firm beliefs Trump might actually have fly in the face of all of them.\nBesides repeatedly donating money to Democratic (and Republican) candidates from whom he tried to get favors, Donald Trump has said publicly that there should be \u201csome form of punishment\u201d for women who get abortions (though he later backtracked under pressure). He\u2019s advocated economic policies that the experts say will start trade wars with China and Mexico. He cheered Brexit because it might drive traffic to his Scottish golf courses (the definition of a conflict of interest), has hinted at using federal resources to go after personal enemies like Jeff Bezos, admits he would continue to let his children run his numerous international businesses while in office, supports \u201copening up\u201d our libel laws to reduce freedom of the press, and apparently believes that global warming is a lie created by China.\nI suppose it would be one thing if these beliefs came from some unique ideological framework but we both know they don\u2019t. He\u2019s a man who reacts, a man who speaks before he thinks (something you always taught me to avoid). These aren\u2019t the meticulously crafted positions of an educated leader surrounded by qualified and informed policy experts\u2014as Trump famously said, he advises himself. There is a quote I read from Winston Churchill recently. During World War One, someone asked why he was reading the work of a certain anti-war poet. \u201cI am not a bit afraid of Siegfried Sassoon,\u201d Churchill said, \u201cThat man can think. I am only afraid of people who cannot think.\u201d\nI think that\u2019s why I am so scared, Dad. That\u2019s why I am writing you this letter. I don\u2019t think this man has done a lick of thinking in years\u2014except about himself and the irrational prejudices and fears which rule his increasingly erratic and bizarre life.\nIf my understanding of where you sit it is correct, you are inclined to agree with most of the criticisms I've just made and yet are swayed by very few of them. As is true for a lot of Americans, I know you\u2019ve been disturbed with a lot what Trump has said and wish sincerely that someone else was running in his place. The problem is\u2014the reason you can\u2019t help but feel pressure to give him the benefit of the doubt or vote for him reluctantly\u2014is that you feel a profound and real distrust towards Hillary Clinton.\nI wasn\u2019t old enough to experience the anger and disillusionment that the Clintons brought to the White House. I get the sense that you see them as thoughtless, careless self-aggrandizers who believe themselves to be above the law. Given the evidence, this is a more than fair assessment. You have real, negative experiences with the last administration and the vague memories of the scandals and noise of that era probably makes another four years seem unappealing. I get it.\nIt was J.K. Galbraith who said that politics was a matter of choosing between the disastrous and the unpalatable. I don\u2019t disagree with you we are dealing with less than ideal options. But surely, unpalatable is better than disastrous.\nThen again, no one is saying you have to vote for Hillary. I\u2019m just asking if you could not vote for Donald Trump. Vote for a third party candidate. For a write-in, you could take a page from Trump\u2019s people, who when they initially had trouble finding people to speak on his behalf at the convention, apparently just put \u201cGeorge Washington\u201d in as a placeholder. Or, what about just not voting in this election? Is that not a powerful statement in its own right? One does not need to endorse disaster just because they resent unpalatable.\nMitt Romney has said that he was finally motivated to get involved in this election when his son asked him, \u201cWhen the grandkids ask \u2018What did you do to stop Donald Trump?\u2019 what are you going to say?\u2019\u201d\nI was so happy to be able to tell you a few weeks ago that you have your first grandchild on the way and that he\u2019s expected to arrive just three days before the election. I think that\u2019s why I am writing this letter too, as my way of asking myself what am I going to do to make sure the world he enters is just a little bit better than the one I came into thirty years ago. I guess I am writing this letter to ask that you, as his grandfather, do what you can to ensure the same.\nSo that when he does ask, not that many years in the future, looking back at what was hopefully just a painful aberration in this nation\u2019s history, we both have a good answer to how we faced this challenge in front of us. And that we acted\u2014despite any personal feelings, or complications or doubts\u2014with principle and courage.\nDad, please don\u2019t vote for Donald Trump. Everything you've taught me about what is wrong in the world is everything that man represents. And if you won't do it for me, do it for your grandchild. Give him something to be proud of\u2014and thankful for.\nYour Loving Son,\nRyan\nRyan Holiday is the best-selling author of Ego is the Enemy and three other books.

His name has been so obscured and forgotten by history that he makes an underappreciated general like George Marshall seem positively famous. At least they named the Marshall Plan after George.\nAs Rome\u2019s highest ranking commander under the Byzan\u00adtine emperor Justinian, Belisarius saved Western civilization on at least three occasions. As Rome collapsed and the seat of the empire moved to Constantinople, Belisarius was the only bright light in a dark time for Christianity. Chances are, you haven\u2019t even heard of him.\nAll the same, the man won brilliant victories at Dara, Carthage, Naples, Sic\u00adily, and Constantinople. He saved the emperor\u2019s life when it was threatened by a riotous mob. He reclaimed farflung territories and recaptured Rome for the first time since it fell\u200a\u2014\u200aall before he was 40.\nHis thanks? He was not given public thanks or celebrations. Instead, he was repeatedly second guessed by the emperor and at the end of his illustrious career, Belisarius was stripped of his wealth, and according to the legend, blinded, and forced to beg in the streets to survive.\nHistorians, scholars, and artists have lamented and argued about this treatment for centuries. They\u2019re rightfully outraged at the ungratefulness, and the pettiness this great and unusual man was subjected to. But guess who never complained about it, even when he had the chance? Belisarius.\nIt seems that he was content to simply do his job. That he took pride in doing it well. And that was enough.\nFor Belisarius, this attitude came from a sense of Christian duty which allowed him to put up with the difficulties inherent in his position. Today, while we hope not to be exposed to this kind of preposterously unjust treatment whether at the hands of our bosses, colleagues or government, we nevertheless must understand that thriving in the real world\u200a\u2014\u200aespecially the creative world\u200a\u2014\u200awill require a similar mindset. Not a religious devotion, but a commitment to the work, as opposed to the rewards.\nThough obvious, we often forget that when we work on a project\u200a\u2014\u200awhetherit\u2019s a book or a business or otherwise\u200a\u2014\u200aat a certain point, that thing leaves our hands and enters the realm of the world. It is judged, received, and acted on by other people (whether they are called audiences, bosses, clients, critics, customers or judges). Their response is outside our control.\nIn other words, even if we do everything right, the reaction might be failure, disrespect, jealousy, or even a resounding yawn from the world. If we are motivated by the wrong thing\u200a\u2014\u200aif ego holds sway\u200a\u2014\u200athis response will crush us.\nI\u2019ve seen it happen a hundred times. I\u2019ve done it myself too.\nBelisarius could win his battles. He could lead his men. He could determine his personal ethics. He could not make the Emperor like and appreciate him. He had no ability to control whether a powerful dicta\u00adtor would treat him well.\nThe same is true for our work. How we respond to this dilemma determines who we are as people as well as the quality of what we will create.\nCan we do the right thing even if it\u2019s not recognized? Will we work hard for something that can be taken away from us? Will we lash out and be wronged just because someone else doesn\u2019t play by the rules?\nI released my book two weeks ago. I sold more copies than I ever expected to sell\u200a\u2014\u200athat\u2019s a good thing. Yet I did not appear on the New York TimesBestseller List (despite rightfully earning a place there) or the Wall Street Journal Bestseller List (where my book should have been number one). Why did this happen? I\u2019m not sure.\nI do know that there are certain games it is possible to play with the list and I chose not to play them. I know that I might have done something that pissed the New York Times off a few years ago\u200a\u2014\u200amaybe they\u2019re still mad about it. I also know that my publisher messed some reporting stuff up that might have impacted my chances on one of the lists. (I did hit the nationalUSA Today list and a few other international lists).\nIn any case, I did all the right things. I wrote the book. I hustled my ass off. I didn\u2019t cheat. And the reward?\nI was screwed over and deprived of something that was mine\u200a\u2014\u200athat would be very good for my career.\nExcept that is a preposterously selfish and short sighted way to look at it. First off, because I actually achieved the thing that the list is supposed to recognize (selling well). In fact, I sold more than I expected to sell, reached a lot of people, and got recognized in some places but not others. But those are not things to take pride in. It\u2019s better to find satisfaction in knowing that I wrote the best book that I was capable of writing. Knowing that I pushed myself continually through the process and emerged better for it. Those are two things that were entirely in my control. If my happiness was dependent on everything else going my way, then I would not only be a hypocrite, but a miserable person most of the time.\nI\u2019m not saying that it\u2019s easy to think this way. I\u2019m not saying that I haven\u2019t had to struggle with my anger about it a dozen times since I first found out. But what else am I going to do? Throw a tantrum? Where will that get me?\nWe need to cultivate the humility and discipline necessary to accept that we have only minimal control over the rewards for our work and effort\u200a\u2014\u200aother people\u2019s validation, recognition, rewards.\nThink of all the activists who will find that they can only advance their cause so far. The leaders who are assassinated before their work is done. The inventors whose ideas lan\u00adguish \u201cahead of their time.\u201d According to society\u2019s main metrics, these people were not rewarded for their work. Should they have not done it? Should they not be kind, not work hard, not produce, because there is a chance it wouldn\u2019t be reciprocated? Should they have done the wrong thing instead?\nC\u2019mon.\nYet in our most egotistical and wounded moments\u200a\u2014\u200awhen struggling with our earsplitting \u201cexpectation hangover\u201d\u200a\u2014\u200aevery one of us has considered doing pre\u00adcisely that. Wanted to say: \u201cFuck \u2019em, they don\u2019t appreciate me anyway.\u201d\nIt might feel good in the short term, but it\u2019s awful in the long term.\nIt\u2019s far better (and more resilient) when doing good work is sufficient. When fulfilling our own standards is what fills us with pride and self respect. When the effort\u200a\u2014\u200anot the results, good or bad\u200a\u2014\u200ais enough.\nIt calls to mind the encounter between Alexander the Great and the famous Cynic philosopher Diogenes. Allegedly, Alexander approached Diogenes, who was lying down, enjoying the summer air, and stood over him and asked what he, the most powerful man in the world, might be able to do for this notoriously poor man. Diogenes could have asked for anything. What he requested was epic: \u201cStop blocking my sun.\u201d Even two thousand years later we can feel exactly where in the solar plexus that must have hit Alexander, a man who always wanted to prove how important he was. As the author Robert Louis Stevenson later observed about this meeting, \u201cIt is a sore thing to have labored along and scaled arduous hilltops, and when all is done, find humanity indifferent to your achievement.\u201d\nWe need to try for that as well. Because maybe our parents will never be impressed. Maybe our girlfriend won\u2019t care. Maybe the investor won\u2019t see the numbers. Maybe the audi\u00adence won\u2019t clap. But we have to be able to push through. We can\u2019t let that be what motivates us.\nHow do you carry on then? How do you take pride in yourself and your work? John Wooden\u2019s advice to his players says it: Change the definition of success. \u201cSuccess is peace of mind, which is a direct result of self satisfaction in knowing you made the effort to do your best to become the best that you are capable of becoming.\u201d \u201cAmbition,\u201d Marcus Aurelius reminded himself, \u201cmeans tying your well\u00adbeing to what other people say or do . . . Sanity means tying it to your own actions.\u201d In other words: Do your work. Do it well. Let that be the end of your concern.\nAnd understand, that even so\u200a\u2014\u200athere will be times when you will be unappreciated. You will be sabotaged. You will experience surprising failures. Your expectations will not be met. You will lose. You will fail.\nRecognition and rewards\u200a\u2014\u200athose must be extra. John Kennedy Toole\u2019s great book A Confederacy of Dunces was universally turned down by publishers, news that so broke his heart that he later committed suicide in his car on an empty road in Biloxi, Mississippi. After his death, his mother discovered the book, advocated on its behalf until it was published, and it eventually won the Pulitzer Prize.\nThink about that for a second. What changed between those submissions? Nothing. The book was the same. It was equally great when Toole had it in manuscript form and had fought with editors about it as it was when the book was published, sold copies, and won awards. If only he could have realized this, it would have saved him so much heart\u00adbreak. He couldn\u2019t, but from his painful example we can at least see how arbitrary many of the breaks in life are.\nThis is why we are the only people who should define what success looks like\u200a\u2014\u200aand that that success should not depend on externals. It should be on us.\nThe world is, after all, indifferent to what we humans \u201cwant.\u201d What can go wrong will. If we persist in wanting, in needing that to not happen?\nOnly misery and disappointment awaits.\nBut if we can find joy and satisfaction in the work? Well that can be ours right now.\nRyan Holiday is the bestselling author of Ego is the Enemy and three other books.

They said: \u201cJust make your boss look good.\u201d\nNow in Hollywood, a world of big egos obsessed with getting credit, there is really no other way for someone just starting out to survive. But it turns out that across industries and across history,aspiring young men and women have used this same approach to get ahead.\nThey realized that the best way to advance their own interests was to do something simple but counterintuitive: provide opportunities for other people. Not only because it makes their boss look good, but because it creates its own opportunities for the pupil to learn and explore.\nFor instance, many people know that as a young man Benjamin Franklin published numerous letters written under fake names like Silence Dogwood. What they don\u2019t know is that Franklin wrote those letters, sub\u00admitted them by sliding them under the print\u00adshop door, and received absolutely no credit for them until much later in his life. In fact, it was his brother, the owner, who profited from their immense popularity, regularly running them on the front page of his newspaper. Franklin was playing the long game, though \u2014 learning how public opinion worked, generating awareness of what he believed in, crafting his style and tone and wit. It was a strategy he used time and again over his career \u2014 once even publishing in his compet\u00aditor\u2019s paper in order to undermine a third competitor \u2014 for Franklin saw the constant benefit in making other people look good and letting them take credit for his ideas.\nOne must master their ego to be able to completely ignore getting credit, getting ahead, even throwing out what your job is supposed to be on paper. It takes a special type of humility to focus your energy on finding, presenting, and facilitating opportunities that help other people succeed.\nBut this is essential.\nBill Belichick, the now four-time Super Bowl-winning coach of the New England Patriots, made his way up the ranks of the NFL by loving and mastering how to do the one thing that coaches hated at the time: analyzing film.\nHis first job in professional football for the Baltimore Colts was one he volunteered to take without pay \u2014 and his insights, which provided ammunition and critical strategies for the game, were attributed exclusively to the other public-facing coaches.  \u201cHe was like a sponge, tak\u00ading it all in, listening to everything,\u201d one coach said. \u201cYou gave him an assignment and he disappeared into a room and you didn\u2019t see him again until it was done, and then he wanted to do more,\u201d said another.\nThis gave him two things: first, a role in the organization that allowed him to thrive and carve out space for himself, two, an understanding of the game that today cannot be matched. And today, Beli\u00adchick has no problem getting paid.\nA few years ago there was some controversy because Sheryl Sandberg, the COO of Facebook, was looking for an unpaid intern. How dare she?! bloggers shouted and yelled. She can afford to pay! Of course, she could. But can you afford to pass on that opportunity?\nThe attitude of the angry, unappreciated genius\u2014that gets us nowhere. Nowhere but living back at home with our parents because \u201cwe\u2019re overqualified\u201d for an entry-level position. Nowhere but a reputation for being a person who doesn\u2019t work well with others, who is entitled and obnoxious.\nMeanwhile, the apprenticeship model is responsible for some of the greatest art in the history of the world\u2014everyone from Michelangelo to Leonardo da Vinci to Benjamin Franklin has been forced to navigate such a system. The greatest networkers in the world practice their art by delivering extraordinary amounts of value to everyone they meet.\nIt\u2019s because they realize what most people\u2019s ego\u2019s prevent them from seeing: that by serving and helping others now, you\u2019re really helping yourself.\nI\u2019ve seen this in my own life. For many years, I was a research assistant and apprentice for the author Robert Greene, creator of the 48 Laws of Power. My job was to contribute little bits and pieces to his books that 99% of the public would have no idea I was responsible for. But I loved it. I did it for years.\nWorking in that system, also taught me the fatal consequences of ego. One slip up, one false belief that you were indispensable to the project, and the door would be shut on you. Important people don\u2019t have time for that. But the quieter and more helpful I could be? The more opportunities I had to contribute. The more I learned. The more trust I was given.\nSlowly I developed my own abilities and was able to pursue my own career. I\u2019m writing this article (and now my own books) because of it.\nThere is an old saying, \u201cSay little, do much.\u201d What we really ought to do is update and apply a version of that to our early approach. Be lesser, do more. Imagine if for every person you met, you thought of some way to help them, something you could do for them? And you looked at it in a way that entirely benefited them and not you. The cumu\u00adlative effect this would have over time would be profound: You\u2019d learn a great deal by solving diverse problems. You\u2019d develop a reputation for being indispensable. You\u2019d have countless new relationships. You\u2019d have an enormous bank of favors to call upon down the road.\nThat\u2019s what this strategy is about \u2014 helping yourself by helping others. Making a concerted effort to trade your short\u00ad term gratification for a longer\u00adterm payoff. Whereas everyone else wants to get credit and be \u201crespected,\u201d you can forget credit. You can forget it so hard that you\u2019re glad when others get it instead of you \u2014 that was your aim, after all. Consider it all an investment.\nThis approach is here for you at anytime. There is no expiration date on it either. It\u2019s one of the few that age does not limit \u2014 on either side, young or old. You can start at any time \u2014 before you have a job, before you\u2019re hired and while you\u2019re doing something else, or if you\u2019re starting something new or find yourself inside an organization with\u00adout strong allies or support. You may even find that there\u2019s no reason to ever stop doing it, even once you\u2019ve graduated to heading your own projects. Let it become natural and permanent \u2014 always, always find opportunities for other people.\nThis piece is adapted from the book Ego is the Enemy, published by Penguin/Portfolio.\nRyan Holiday is the bestselling author of Ego Is The Enemy and three other books.

Stuck in a job we don\u2019t like. Stuck across town because a meeting was cancelled. Stuck with an obligation that someone else signed us up for. Stuck in a failing company. \nWe\u2019re stuck\u2014we don\u2019t have a choice about that. But we do have a choice about something else: What will we do with this time? \nIn 1946, Malcolm X was sentenced to 10 years in prison. Even accounting for the shameful American racism and whatever systematic legal injustices existed at the time, Mal\u00adcolm X was guilty. He deserved to go to jail. And now he had roughly a decade to sit in a cage. \nAs Malcolm X entered that prison he faced that same choice. He faced what Robert Greene\u2014a man who sixty years later would find his wildly popular books banned in many federal prisons\u2014calls an \u201cAlive Time or Dead Time\u201d scenario. How would the seven years he would serve play out? What would Malcolm do with this time?                                \nAccording to Greene, there are two types of time in our lives: dead time, when people are passive and waiting, and alive time, when people are learning and acting and utiliz\u00ading every second. Every moment of failure, every moment or situation that we did not deliberately choose or control, presents this choice: Alive time. Dead time.\nWhich will it be?\nMalcolm chose alive time. He began to learn. He explored religion. He taught himself to be a reader by checking out a pencil and the dictionary from the prison library and not only consumed it from start to finish, but copied it down long\u2010hand from cover to cover. All these words he\u2019d never known existed before were transferred to his brain. \nAs he said later, \u201cFrom then until I left that prison, in every free moment I had, if I was not reading in the library, I was reading in my bunk.\u201d He read history, he read sociol\u00adogy, he read about religion, he read the classics, he read philosophers like Kant and Spinoza. Later, a reporter asked Malcolm, \u201cWhat\u2019s your alma mater?\u201d His one word answer: \u201cBooks.\u201d\nPrison became his college. He transcended confine\u00adment through the pages he absorbed. He reflected that months passed without him even thinking about being detained against his will. He had \u201cnever been so truly free in his life.\u201d \nAnd yet, here we are, stuck in our own way. Maybe you\u2019re sitting in a remedial high school class, maybe you\u2019re watching for the numbers to come in on your newest launch, maybe it\u2019s a trial separation, maybe you\u2019re stuck making smoothies or living at home while you save up money, maybe you\u2019re stuck waiting out a contract or a tour of duty. Maybe this situation is one totally of your own making, or perhaps it\u2019s just bad luck. \nThe ego in all of us wants to complain about how this situation sucks. How it\u2019s unfair. How we\u2019d rather be doing just about anything else. And it\u2019s this attitude that creates dead time we can never get back. In this way, ego is the mortal enemy of alive time. \nBut if we\u2019re humble, accepting and creative, we can transform seemingly terrible situations\u2014a prison sentence, a dysfunctional job, a bear market or depression, military conscription, a failing company\u2014 turned those circumstances into fuel for greatness.   \nWe can ask ourselves: What can I accomplish here? What can I do with this time? Think of what you have been putting off. Issues you declined to deal with. Systemic problems that felt too over\u00adwhelming to address. Dead time is revived when we use it as an opportunity to do what we\u2019ve long needed to do\u2014from having difficult conversations to squeezing in some quiet reading time. \nFrancis Scott Key wrote the poem that became the national anthem of the United States while trapped on a ship during a prisoner exchange in the War of 1812. Viktor Frankl refined his psychologies of meaning and suffering during his ordeal in three Nazi concentration camps. Not that these opportunities always come in such serious situa\u00adtions. The author Ian Fleming was on bed rest and, per doc\u00adtors\u2019 orders, forbidden from using a typewriter. They were worried he\u2019d exert himself by writing another Bond novel. So he created Chitty-Chitty-Bang-Bang: The Magical Car by hand instead. Walt Disney made his decision to become a cartoonist while laid up after stepping on a rusty nail. \n\u201cMany a serious thinker has been produced in prisons,\u201d as Robert Greene put it, \u201cwhere we have nothing to do but think.\u201d Well, at the very least, our situation can be used for that. To get some serious thinking done.\nIt\u2019s easy to angry, to be aggrieved, to be depressed or heartbroken. I don\u2019t want this. I want ______. I want it my way. But this accomplishes nothing!\nAs they say, this moment is not your life. But it is a moment in your life. How will you use it? \nLet us say, the next time we find ourselves stuck: This is an opportunity for me. I am using it for my purposes. I will not let this be dead time for me. The dead time was when we were controlled by ego. \nAs Booker T. Washington most famously put it, \u201cCast down your bucket where you are.\u201d Make use of what\u2019s around you. Even the dead time. Because while its occurrence isn\u2019t in our control. Its use, on the other hand, is. \nThis piece is adapted from Ryan Holiday\u2019s book Ego is the Enemy, published by Penguin Portfolio                                                           \nRyan Holiday is the bestselling author of Ego Is The Enemy and three other books.

What is the process?\nIt can be traced to Nick Saban, the famous coach of LSU and Alabama\u2014perhaps the most dominant dynasty in the history of college football. But he got it from a psychiatry professor named Lionel Rosen during his time at Michigan State.\nRosen\u2019s big insight was this: sports\u2014especially football\u2014are complex. Nobody has enough brainpower or motivation to consistently manage all the variables going on in the course of a season, let alone a game. They think they do\u2014but realistically, they don\u2019t.\nThere are too many plays, too many players, too many statistics, countermoves, unpredictables, distractions. Over the course of a long playoff season, this adds up into a cognitively impossible load. Meanwhile, as Monte Burke writes in his book Saban, Rosen discovered that the average play in football lasts just seven seconds. Seven seconds\u2014that\u2019s very manageable.\n  Nick Saban, head coach of the Alabama Crimson Tide (Photo by Rodger Mallison/Fort Worth Star-Telegram/TNS via Getty Images)\nSo he posed a question: What if a team concentrated only on what they could manage? What if they took things step by step\u2014not focusing on anything but what was right in front of them and on doing it well?\nAs a result, Nick Saban doesn\u2019t focus on what every other coach focuses on, or at least not the way they do. He tells them:\n\u201cDon\u2019t think about winning the SEC Championship. Don\u2019t think about the national championship. Think about what you needed to do in this drill, on this play, in this moment. That\u2019s the process: Let\u2019s think about what we can do today, the task at hand.\u201d\nIt\u2019s this message that\u2019s been internalized by his players and his teams\u2014which together have four national championships in an eight-year span, one Mid-American Conference championship, have been crowned SEC champions 15 times and Saban has received multiple coaching awards.\nIn the chaos of sport, as in life, process provides a way. A way to turn something very complex into something simple. Not that simple is easy.\nBut it is easier. Let\u2019s say you\u2019ve got to do something difficult. Don\u2019t focus on that. Instead break it down into pieces. Simply do what you need to do right now. And do it well. And then move on to the next thing. Follow the process and not the prize. As Bill Belichick famously put it, just do your job.\nThe road to back-to-back championships, or being a writer or a successful entrepreneur is just that, a road. And you travel along a road in steps. Excellence is a matter of steps. Excelling at this one, then that one and then the one after that. Saban\u2019s process is exclusively this\u2014existing in the present, taking it one step at a time, not getting distracted by anything else. Not the other team, not the scoreboard, or the crowd.\nThe process is about finishing. Finishing games. Finishing workouts. Finishing film sessions. Finishing drives. Finishing reps. Finishing plays. Finishing blocks. Finishing the smallest task you have right in front of you and finishing it well.\nWhether it\u2019s pursuing the pinnacle of success in your field, or simply surviving some awful or trying ordeal, the same approach works. Don\u2019t think about the end\u2014think about surviving. Getting it right from meal to meal, meeting to meeting, project to project, paycheck to paycheck, one day at a time.\nAnd when you really get it right, even the hardest things become manageable. As Heraclitus observed, \u201cunder the comb, the tangle and the straight path are the same.\u201d That\u2019s what the process is. Under its influence, we needn\u2019t panic. Even mammoth tasks become just a series of component parts.\nThis was what the great 19th-century pioneer of meteorology, James Pollard Espy, had shown to him in a chance encounter as a young man. Unable to read and write until he was 18, Espy attended a rousing speech by the famous orator Henry Clay. After the talk, a spellbound Espy tried to make his way toward Clay, but he couldn\u2019t form the words to speak to his idol. One of his friends shouted out for him: \u201cHe wants to be like you, even though he can\u2019t read.\u201d\nClay grabbed one of his posters, which had the word CLAY written in big letters. He looked at Espy and said, \u201cYou see that, boy?\u201d pointing to a letter. \u201cThat\u2019s an A. Now, you\u2019ve only got 25 more letters to go.\u201d\nEspy had just been gifted The Process. Within a year, he started college.\nWhat Rosen, what Espy, what these coaches are practicing is a central tenet of stoic philosophy\u2014one which I\u2019ve tried to pass along in The Obstacle is The Way. It\u2019s just a modern take on Marcus Aurelius when he advised:\n\u201cDon\u2019t let your imagination be crushed by life as a whole. Don\u2019t try to picture everything bad that could possibly happen. Stick with the situation at hand, and ask, \u201cWhy is this so unbearable? Why can\u2019t I endure it?\u201d\nStatue of the Roman emperor Marcus Aurelius (Photo: Getty Images)\nSeven seconds. Sticking to the situation at hand. Focusing on what\u2019s immediately in front of you. No strain, no struggling. So relaxed. No exertion or worry. Just one simple movement after another. That\u2019s the power of process.\nWe can channel this, too. We needn\u2019t scramble like we\u2019re so often inclined to do when some difficult task sits in front of us. Instead, we can take a breath, do the immediate, composite part in front of us\u2014and follow its thread into the next action. Everything in order, everything connected.\nWhen it comes to our actions, disorder and distraction are death. The unordered mind loses track of what\u2019s in front of it\u2014what matters\u2014and gets distracted by thoughts of the future. The process is order, it keeps our perceptions in check and our actions in sync.\nIt seems obvious, but we forget this when it matters most.\nRight now, if I knocked you down and pinned you to ground, how would you respond? You\u2019d probably panic. And then you\u2019d push with all your strength to get me off you. It wouldn\u2019t work; just using my body weight, I would be able to keep your shoulders against the ground with little effort\u2014and you\u2019d grow exhausted fighting it.\nThat\u2019s the opposite of the process.\nThe process is much easier. First, you don\u2019t panic, you conserve your energy. You don\u2019t do anything stupid like get yourself choked out by acting without thinking. You focus on not letting it get worse. Then you get your arms up, to brace and create some breathing room, some space. Now work to get on your side.  From there you can start to break down my hold on you: grab an arm, trap a leg, buck with your hips, slide in a knee.\nIt\u2019ll take some time, but you\u2019ll get yourself out. At each step, the person on top is forced to give a little up, until there\u2019s nothing left. Then you\u2019re free.\nBeing trapped is just a position, not a fate. You get out of it by addressing and eliminating each part of that position through small, deliberate action\u2014not by trying (and failing) to push it away with superhuman strength.\nWith our business rivals, we rack our brains to think of some mind-blowing new product that will make them irrelevant, and, in the process, we take our eye off the ball. We shy away from writing a book or making a film even though it\u2019s our dream because it\u2019s so much work\u2014we can\u2019t imagine how we get from here to there.\nHow often do we compromise or settle because we feel that the real solution is too ambitious or outside our grasp? How often do we assume that change is impossible because it\u2019s too big? Involves too many different groups? Or worse, how many people are paralyzed by all their ideas and inspirations? They chase them all and go nowhere, distracting themselves and never making headway. They\u2019re brilliant, sure, but they rarely execute. They rarely get where they want and need to go.\nAll these issues are solvable. Each would collapse beneath the process. We\u2019ve just wrongly assumed that it has to happen all at once, and we give up at the thought of it. We are A-to-Z thinkers, fretting about A, obsessing over Z, yet forgetting all about B through Y.\nWe want to have goals, yes, so everything we do can be in service of something purposeful. When we know what we\u2019re really setting out to do, the obstacles that arise tend to seem smaller, more manageable. When we don\u2019t, each one looms larger and seems impossible. Goals help put the blips and bumps in proper proportion.\nWhen we get distracted, when we start caring about something other than our own progress and efforts, the process is the helpful, if occasionally bossy, voice in our head. It is the bark of the wise, older leader who knows exactly who he is and what he\u2019s got to do. Shut up. Go back to your stations and try to think about what we are going to do ourselves, instead of worrying about what\u2019s going on out there. You know what your job is, stop jawing and get to work.\nThe process is the voice that demands we take responsibility and ownership. That prompts us to act even if only in a small way.\nLike a relentless machine, subjugating resistance each and every way it exists, little by little. Moving forward, one step at a time. Subordinate strength to the process. Replace fear with the process. Depend on it. Lean on it. Trust in it.\nTake your time, don\u2019t rush. Some problems are harder than others. Deal with the ones right in front of you first. Come back to the others later. You\u2019ll get there.\nThe process is about doing the right things, right now. Not worrying about what might happen later, or the results, or the whole picture.\nRyan Holiday is the best-selling author of The Obstacle Is the Way: The Timeless Art of Turning Trials into Triumph and two other books."}, {"author": "Ryan Holiday", "headline": "The Single Worst Marketing Decision You Can Make", "body": "Make something people want.\n\u2014Paul Graham\nYou know what the single worst marketing decision you can make is? Starting with a product nobody wants or nobody needs.\nYet for years, this was a scenario that marketers tolerated and accepted as part of the job. We all told ourselves that \u201cyou go to market with the product you have, not the one you want.\u201d And then we wondered why our strategies failed\u2014and why those failures were so expensive.\nWhat attracted me to growth hacking from the very start was that it rejects this obviously flawed approach outright. Growth hackers believe that products\u2014even whole businesses and business models\u2014can and should be changed until they are primed to generat explosive reactions from the first people who see them. In other words, the best marketing decision you can make is to have a product or business that fulfills a real and compelling need for a real and defined group of people\u2014no matter how much tweaking and refining this takes.\nTake Airbnb, a start-up now valued at some $10 billion. Today we know it as a site where, as cofounder Brian Chesky put it, \u201cyou can book space anywhere. It can be anything, and it really is anything from a tent to a castle.\u201d But in 2007, the business started as a way for the founders to turn the living room of their loft apartment into a little bed-and-breakfast. The founders named it airbedandbreakfast.com and put out air mattresses on their floor and offered free homemade breakfast to guests. But the founders wanted more.\nGoing back to the drawing board and hoping to capitalize on popular technology and design conferences, the founders repositioned the service as a networking alternative for attendees when hotels were booked up. This was clearly a better market, but the company sensed they could improve the idea further, so they pivoted slightly to target the type of traveler who didn\u2019t want to crash on couches or in hostels but was looking to avoid hotels. This did better still. Finally, based on feedback and usage patterns, they shortened the name to airbnb and abandoned the breakfast and networking parts of the business, redefining the service as a place for people to rent or book any kind of lodging imaginable (from rooms to apartments to trains, boats, castles, penthouses, and private islands). This was explosive\u2014to the tune of millions of bookings a year in locations all over the world.\nAirbnb had a good idea in 2007, but the actual value proposition, if we\u2019re being honest, was a little mediocre. The founders could have spent all their time and energy trying to force the \u201clet people crash on your floor and feed them breakfast\u201d angle and creating a small business around it. Instead, they treated their product and service as something malleable and were able to change and improve it until they found its best iteration. They went from a good but fairly impractical idea to an explosive and practical idea, and then as a result, a billion-dollar valuation. This switch was undoubtedly the best marketing decision they ever could have made.\nAs a traditional marketer, I can think of precisely zero times when we went back to the drawing board after seeing a less-than-stellar response. It wasn\u2019t permitted. Our only move was to put more muscle behind bad products and companies.\nIt was a wake-up call to me to learn that Airbnb was by no means unique: Instagram started as a location-based social network called Burbn (which had an optional photo feature). It attracted a core group of users and more than $500,000 in funding. And yet the founders realized that its users were flocking to only one part of the app\u2014the photos and filters. They had a meeting, which one of the founders recounts like this: \u201cWe sat down and said, \u2018What are we going to work on next? How are we going to evolve this product into something millions of people will want to use? What is the one thing that makes this product unique and interesting?\u2019\"\nThe service soon retooled to become Instagram as we know it: a mobile app for posting photos with filters. The result? One hundred thousand users within a week of relaunching. Within eighteen months, the founders sold Instagram to Facebook for $1 billion.\nI know that seems simple, that the marketing lesson from Instragram is that they made a product that was just awesome. But that\u2019s good news for you\u2014it means there\u2019s no secret sauce, and the second your product gets to be that awesome, you can see similar results. Just look at Snapchat, which essentially followed the same playbook by innovating in the mobile photo app space, blew up with young people, and skyrocketed to a $3.5-billion-dollar valuation with next-to-no marketing.\nSome companies like Airbnb and Instragram spend a long time trying new iterations until they achieve what growth hackers call Product Market Fit (PMF); others find it right away. The end goal is the same, however, and it\u2019s to have the product and its customers in perfect sync with each other. Eric Ries, author of The Lean Startup, explains that the best way to get to Product Market Fit is by starting with a \u201cminimum viable product\u201d and improving it based on feedback\u2014as opposed to what most of us do, which is to try to launch publicly with what we think is our final, perfected product.\nToday, it is the marketer\u2019s job as much as anyone else\u2019s to make sure Product Market Fit happens. Your marketing efforts are wasted on a mediocre product\u2014so don\u2019t tolerate mediocrity. OK?\nBut rather than waiting for it to happen magically or assuming that this is some other department\u2019s job, marketers need to contribute to this process. Isolating who your customers are, figuring out their needs, designing a product that will blow their minds\u2014these are marketing decisions, not just development and design choices.\nThe imperative is clear: stop sitting on your hands and start getting them dirty. Optimizing a product to spread and be well received by customers, by the media, and by influencers is something that you, as a marketer or a growth hacker, are uniquely qualified to do. You are, in effect, the translator who helps bridge the producers and the consumers so they are in alignment.\nAnd this is true whether you\u2019re making some physical gadget, designing a menu, or creating an app. Someone has to be the advocate for the potential market (customers), and the earlier their influence is felt in the process, the better.\nAmazon has actually made this part of their basic procedures. Ian McAllister, general manager at Amazon, calls this approach \u201cworking backwards from the customer.\u201d For new initiatives, employees begin by creating an internal press release that announces this new potential project as though it was just finished. It\u2019s addressed to the customers\u2014whoever they happen to be\u2014and explains how this new offering solves their problems in an exciting or compelling way.\nIf the press release cannot do that, the initiative is tweaked and tweaked and tweaked until it can, according to McAllister, Amazon encourages product managers to think like Oprah\u2014that is, would she rapturously shout about this product if she were giving it away to her fans as a gift?\nThe exercise forces the team to focus on exactly what its potential new product is and what\u2019s special about it. I guarantee that someone with a mind that bends toward growth hacking put this policy into place.\nNo longer content to let the development happen as it happens, we can influence it with input, with rules and guidelines, and with feedback. The growth hacker helps with iterations, advises, and analyzes every facet of the business. In other words, Product Market Fit is a feeling backed with data and information.\nHow Do You Get PMF?\nBecause Product Market Fit can be overwhelming as a technical business concept, allow me to explain it by dropping the jargon and presenting an analogy. As it turns out, I was familiar with PMF long before I read Andrew Chen\u2019s article.\nMuch of the marketing I do is with authors and books. I\u2019ve worked with dozens of bestsellers in the last five years\u2014and, of course, I\u2019ve also worked on many books that weren\u2019t successful. In my experience, the books that tend to flop upon release are those where the author goes into a cave for a year to write it, then hands it off to the publisher for release. They hope for a hit that rarely comes.\nOn the other hand, I have clients who blog extensively before publishing. They develop their book ideas based on the themes that they naturally gravitate toward but that also get the greatest response from readers. (One client sold a book proposal using a screenshot of Google queries to his site.) They test the ideas they\u2019re writing about in the book on their blog and when they speak in front of groups. They ask readers what they\u2019d like to see in the book. They judge topic ideas by how many comments a given post generates, by how many Facebook \u201cshares\u201d an article gets. They put potential title and cover ideas up online to test and receive feedback. They look to see what hot topics other influential bloggers are riding and find ways of addressing them in their book.*\nThe latter achieves PMF; the former never does. One is growth hacking; the other, simply guessing.\nOne is easy for me to market. The other is often a lost cause. One needs only a small shove to get going. The other has a strong headwind every step of the way.\nAmazon, for its part, has a couple of other easy suggestions for you if the advice \u201cwrite a hypothetical press release\u201d doesn\u2019t quite work for your situation. Their CTO, Werner Vogels, suggests trying to write an FAQ for this product you\u2019re developing. (That way you can address, in advance, potential user issues and questions.) Or try to define the crucial parts of the user experience by making mockups of pages, writing hypothetical case studies so you can actually start to see what it would look like and who it would work for and how. Finally, try writing the user manual, which as Werner explains usually has three parts: concepts, how-to, and reference. (Defining these means you understand your idea in and out from the customers perspective. Also, he says, if you have more than one type of user then write multiple manuals.)\nI love those ideas. They might feel like homework, but they force you to imagine your product from someone\u2019s perspective other than your own. That\u2019s the best way to get to PMF\u2014because ultimately this isn\u2019t about you; it\u2019s about the people you\u2019re trying to turn into customers.\nPerhaps you\u2019ll get to PMF with one aha moment like Instagram, or it may be incremental percent improvements. As Marc Andreessen\u2014the entrepreneur behind Netscape, Opsware, and Ning who, in addition to running a major venture capital fund, happens to be on the board of directors for Facebook, eBay, and HP\u2014explains it, companies need to \u201cdo whatever is required to get to product/market fit. Including changing out people, rewriting your product, moving into a different market, telling customers no when you don\u2019t want to, telling customers yes when you don\u2019t want to, raising that fourth round of highly dilutive venture capital\u2014whatever is required.\u201d\nIn other words: everything is now on the table.\nOpen Up to Feedback\nPart of this new approach is having the humility to accept that marketers are not necessarily the most critical members of the team. It\u2019s true. Sometimes the best thing marketers can do is to not let people get distracted by \u201cmarketing\u201d for a minute. Sometimes the outward-facing part of the job is exactly the least important part.\nTake Evernote, a start-up that offers productivity and organization software, which made the companywide decision to delay spending even a penny on marketing for the first several years of its growth. As Evernote\u2019s founder, Phil libin, told a group of entrepreneurs in a now-classic talk, \u201cPeople [who are] thinking about things other than making the best product, never make the best product.\u201d So Evernote took \u201cmarketing\u201d off the table and instead poured that budget into product development. This undoubtedly slowed brand building at first\u2014but it paid off. Why? Because Evernote is far and away the most superior productivity and note-taking application on the planet. Today, it practically markets itself.\nPerhaps this is what you need to do. I know you\u2019re probably reading this book looking for some immediate tips you can put into action\u2014places you can deploy your budget or resources. But let\u2019s think outside the box\u2014 outside the budget\u2014and consider whether improving your product might be the best strategy.\nThat\u2019s not to say you shouldn\u2019t do anything at all. Evernote still came up with a bunch of clever tricks to get people to see its products while marketing was on their strategic back burner. After hearing customers complain that their bosses were suspicious of employees using their laptops in meetings, the Evernote team produced stickers that said, \u201cI\u2019m not being rude. I\u2019m taking notes in Evernote.\u201d Thus, their most loyal customers were turning into billboards that went from meeting to meeting.\nOnce we stop thinking of the products we market as static\u2014that our job as marketers is to simply work with what we\u2019ve got instead of working on and improving what we\u2019ve got\u2014the whole game changes. Now we are not helpless, repeatedly pitching a product to reporters and users that is not resonating. Instead, we use this information to improve the product, with the idea of ultimately refining our idea into something that can in many ways sell itself.\nThe race has changed. The prize and spoils no longer go to the person who makes it to market first. They go to the person who makes it to Product Market Fit first. Because once you get there, your marketing efforts become like a spark applied to a bed of kindling soaked in kerosene. The old way? It\u2019s striking a match...and hoping it starts a fire somewhere.\nThe point is: marketing as we know it is a waste of time without PMF.\nOf course, there are many tools to help get you there. From Google to Optimizely to KISSmetrics, there are great services that allow you to see what your users are actually doing and responding to on your site. This insight will get you closer to a fit than gut instincts ever will.\nBut the most effective method is simply the Socratic method. We must simply and repeatedly question every assumption. Who is this product for? Why would they use it? Why do I use it?\nask your customers questions, too: What is it that brought you to this product? What is holding you back from referring other people to it? What\u2019s missing? What\u2019s golden? Don\u2019t ask random people or your friends\u2014be scientific about it. Use tools like Surveymonkey, Wufoo, Qualaroo, or even Google Docs, which make it very easy to offer surveys to some or all of your customers.\nFor the first time we can ask these questions because we intend to do something about it. No more privately complaining to friends, coworkers, and spouses that we\u2019re stuck with a product nobody wants.\nNot to say that you must use all the data that comes back, but you should have it. The black-box approach is no longer necessary. Change is possible\u2014which means you need to make yourself available and open to it.\nProduct Market Fit is not some mythical status that happens accidentally. Companies work for it; they crawl toward it. They\u2019re ready to throw out weeks or months of\nN work because the evidence supports that decision. The services as their customers know them now are fundamentally different from what they were at launch\u2014before they had Product Market Fit.\nBut once these companies get PMF, they don\u2019t just wait and hope that success will come along on its own. The next step is to bring the customers in.\nRyan Holiday is a media strategist and prominent writer on strategy and business.

Just reading the names and sources of wealth gave me motivation, but I was often left without inspiration. Why? I yearned to see someone who looked like me \u2014 someone who was black. I didn\u2019t quite believe I could aspire to the upper heights of wealth without first seeing someone who looked like me do it. Nevertheless, year after year I gobbled up every bit of information from each issue and when media magnate Bob Johnson made the list in 2001, as the first African American Billionaire, I was incredibly proud.\nIn the 15 years since Johnson\u2019s pioneering add, only three other African Americans have joined the exclusive billionaire club. However, in 2017 I believe we\u2019ll see not only the fourth African American to join, but we\u2019ll all witness the first billionaire Bad Boy.\nSean \u201cDiddy\u201d Combs is unquestionably a consummate entrepreneur. I predict his portfolio of Bad Boy Records, Revolt TV, Wine & Spirits, Sean John, AQUAhydrate, and more, currently valued at $750 Million, will see an overall increase in valuation strong enough to push him over the billion dollar mark. However, Diddy becoming a billionaire should not be taken lightly. It\u2019s significance carries major impact, especially in 3 categories:\nHe\u2019ll Be An Economic Pioneer\nCombs will become only the 4th African American to ever make the exclusive billionaire club, instantly making him a black economic pioneer. \u201cThey\u2019ll be what they see\u201d is a powerful mantra of the 100 Black Men organization and for many of the world\u2019s black people, Mr. Combs' triumph becomes another beacon of hope towards our financial empowerment. Despite making great strides over the last several decades, we still lag behind in every economic category, including broad disparities in unemployment and poverty rates. Namely because of Sean Combs' global and multigenerational influence, he is poised to become an inspirational symbol of economic power.\nHe\u2019ll Legitimize The Economic Power Of Hip-Hop\nDiddy becoming a billionaire also helps to legitimize the economic power of hip-hop, still considered a new (and for some) a weakening genre of music. Among all genres of music, hip-hop, founded in just 1973, is still relatively young compared to other popular categories such as rock, pop, and soul. Yet, out of all genres of music, only rock has created a billionaire, with Sir Paul McCartney. The only other musically associated billionaire is theatrical composer, Andrew Lloyd Webber. Sean Combs becoming a billionaire will make him only the 3rd musical artist in history to do so. Not bad coming from a newbie music genre. Further supporting hip-hop\u2019s overall economic power, behind Combs is a long list of rappers and rap producers with substantial wealth. I predict hip-hop artist Jay Z and hip-hop super producer Dr. Dre, with a net worth of $610 million and $700 million respectively, to join the billionaire club in the near future. \nHe\u2019ll Break The Rules Of Massive Wealth Creation\nLastly, Diddy\u2019s diverse portfolio of assets suggests the path to billionaire status doesn\u2019t require the traditional strategy of having only one major source of investment. Of the 1,810 world billionaires, Forbes lists more than 98% deriving the majority of their wealth from a single source (think Bill Gates with Microsoft, Reid Hoffman with LinkedIn, Jeff Bezos with Amazon, etc). Sean Combs is the exception to the traditional billionaire \u201cwealth source\u201d rule. His diversified portfolio of music, spirits, clothing, media, & startup investments equally contribute to his wealth. Sean \u201cDiddy\u201d Combs proves that Bad Boys who break the rules don\u2019t have to finish last. \nThis article is part of the LinkedIn Top Voices list, a collection of the must-read writers of the year.

While my stance on the importance of companionship and marriage remain unchanged, it\u2019s become clear that \u201cdating\u201d as we traditionally understand it, has forever changed.\nAll trends suggest a significant decrease in dating around the world. This, compounded by research that suggests the average single doesn\u2019t go on one date in a year, will result in what I believe to be the most significant drop in the percentage of people who date ever seen in modern history. I believe 80% of singles will not go on one date in 2017. There are five factors driving the global dating decline:\n1) Dating App Analysis Paralysis\nThere are literally thousands of mobile dating apps and websites, so many that for any niche or abstract interest you can think of, there is most likely a dating site for it. With virtually millions of singles ready to connect, you would think dating should increase. The issue, however, is in that perceived pool of daters, the fact that users of these sites and apps believe there is an endless number of options creates a dangerous psychological effect best described in psychologist's Barry Schwartz\u2019s book Paradox of Choice. Schwartz argues that more is actually less and when presented with more options, we derive less satisfaction and happiness. Moreover, such abundant options often cause an analysis paralysis where we over-analyze or over-think a situation so that a decision or action is never taken. This is precisely what\u2019s happening with dating apps and sites today. Users have what they believe are so many options that they rarely connect with the options they do have (and when they do connect, have little satisfaction with their choices).\n2) Cheapening of Sex\nNever in our lifetime has sex been so easy to come by and at the same time valued so little. At the touch of a mobile phone, you can order anything from pornography to a prostitute. If the cost of the former is too high, one of the thousands of \u201chook-up\u201d apps can deliver you effortless free sex within moments. Just 15 years ago, sex was often the result of effort put forth through courting and committed dating. Today, sex is often expected before dating even begins. As so many people have told me \u201cwhy date when I can remain single and get sex whenever I want it.\u201d  \n3) Drop in Value of Marriage\nThe most alarming statistic foreshadowing the decline of dating comes from a 2014 Pew Research survey that found 67% of millennials no longer see value in getting married. This is an incredibly sobering figure for marriage advocates. Once someone no longer believes they should put effort towards marriage, the prerequisite action of dating becomes no longer necessary. \n4) No One Knows What \u201cDating\u201d Means Anymore\nAsk 10 people to define what dating means and you\u2019ll get 10 different answers. I asked this question recently to my social media community and received a wide range of responses from \u201cjust hanging out\u201d to \u201cit\u2019s like a job interview\u201d to \u201cit means going somewhere exciting.\u201d The fact that there are so many disparate opinions of the word \u201cdating\u201d suggests it no longer has real meaning. For the record, my definition of dating: is an activity two people participate in to either determine if there is serious romantic interest or to further already established serious romantic interest.   \n5) Lack of Belief\nThrough my interactions with singles as clients, at events, and through social media communication, I\u2019ve witnessed a significant shift in belief over the years. When I originally began my career in the love industry 8 years ago, the questions I heard mostly focused on \u201cwhere\u201d or \u201chow\u201d to find a husband or wife. However, over recent years, the overwhelming most popular question from both women and men focuses on \u201cif\" there are any good men or women left. This may seem subtle, but significance can be found in the mindset behind the question. Our belief becomes our reality. If you\u2019re single and doubt a romantic partner exists, you don\u2019t have any motivation to pursue love, let alone go on a date.  \nThis article is part of the LinkedIn Top Voices list, a collection of the must-read writers of the year.

Here\u2019s How I Found Mine.", "body": "There has been no greater impact on my professional, personal, and romantic life than having mentors. That\u2019s right, I have someone\u2019s guidance in every aspect of my life so, yes, I even have a love mentor! The benefit of mentorship hasn\u2019t only been through my role as mentee, I\u2019ve also realized the power of being a mentor, starting in college with the Big Brothers Big Sisters program and continuing through today where I still mentor several people.\nWhile mentorship has a certain meaning to many, it\u2019s not neatly defined, causing confusion about exactly \u201cwhat is a mentoring relationship?\u201d The largest misconception I\u2019ve noticed is the thought you can\u2019t be mentored unless you have an official relationship with someone who confirms they\u2019re your mentor. This is an old and limiting belief. I spent the early part of my business career being mentored by Steve Jobs, Bill Gates, Susan Taylor, & Reginald Lewis. None of them knew it, though. I believe simply listening to someone\u2019s speeches, reading articles and blog posts they\u2019ve written, or exchanging thoughts with them via social media, can all be considered \u201cbeing mentored.\u201d At the end of the day, I define mentorship as a personal development in which a more experienced or more knowledgeable person guides a less experienced or less knowledgeable person.\nThat being said, you won\u2019t get an argument from me about whether formal mentorship is more effective. It\u2019s MUCH more effective! A relationship with established roles and defined expectations always gets optimal results. So how do you structure a formal mentoring relationship, especially with someone who is highly sought after? Well, the first thing to know is while it may seem against conventional thought, whatever you do, please, please, please do not ask someone to be your mentor. Seems strange, right? You would think in order for someone to be a mentor, you would need to ask them.\nThe problem is when we ask we\u2019re typically asking strangers, people we have only met recently, or those we don\u2019t yet have strong bonds with. Sheryl Sandberg, COO of Facebook, sums it up best in her book Lean In:\n\u201cIf someone has to ask the question, the answer is probably no. When someone finds the right mentor, it is obvious.  The question becomes a statement. Chasing or forcing that connection rarely works.\u201d\n So the real question is not so much \u201chow to ask someone to be a mentor\u201d but rather, \u201chow to build a rapport with someone you would like to become your mentor?\u201d Here are the 5 steps I used (as well as steps that were used on me) to seal the deal on my most rewarding mentoring relationships.\n  1. Become Mentee Material\nAre you somebody you yourself would like to mentor? Are you open, flexible, resilient, and respectful? Are you eager to learn, and committed to modifying how you\u2019re interacting in the world so you can have even more success, reward and happiness?\nIf the answer is \u201cno\u201d don\u2019t move to step 2 until you nail this one first. It took several failed mentoring relationships for me to appreciate the importance of becoming mentee material. Be someone who is already actively building his/her life, and is demonstrating that every day.\n  2. Make Sure The Person Shares Your Values\nDon\u2019t simply see their awards and accolades and because you aspire for those same things believe he or she is the right person to guide you. It\u2019s critical that you know your potential mentor has the same values you do. Values are essentially your guidebook to life. If your mentor has different values, it means they play by a different set of rules from you. Some of which you may consider immoral or unethical.\nMost people searching for a mentor don\u2019t focus on values because they either don\u2019t know their own (and so don\u2019t have anything to match against) or don\u2019t want to expend the effort to assess someone else\u2019s values. Determining someone\u2019s values requires dedication. You have to watch actions play out over time. While values are key, I don\u2019t believe any other similarities are critical \u2013 so your mentor doesn\u2019t need to be the same ethnicity, religion, gender, or nationality. My greatest mentors (like Ed Neff pictured above) have all been different from me in many aspects, but we always had the same values in common. Shared values are the single most important matchmaking category for success (and that\u2019s in all relationships \u2013 business, platonic, and romantic). \n  3. Advocate For Their Work!\nTweet their posts, comment in a positive way on their blogs, share their updates, start a discussion on LinkedIn about a post they\u2019ve made, promote and attend a live talk they\u2019re giving, and the list goes on.  In short, offer your unique voice, perspectives, experiences and resources to further the action and conversation that these influencers have sparked.  Understand that you are able to be of service to them, and go out and do it. In particular, show up in their comments \u2013 this is where many people with large followings go to for their \u201coxygen.\u201d Continue to show up, give insight, and provide value, consistently. It\u2019s important to note this step isn\u2019t simply about advocating their work for a few weeks and thinking you\u2019ll be noticed immediately. It takes time and keep in mind, you may never be recognized for being their advocate. It took me 4 years of consistently promoting and attending his independent film events before finally connecting with someone who later became my mentor, Ed Neff. What got me through those many years of advocating with no reciprocation was shifting my mindset to giving with no expectation. \n  4. Elevate Your Value To Them Over Time\nGo beyond the comments and offer ideas, refer new clients or business to them. What finally placed me in a position of strength with Ed was when I introduced him to a potential acquirer of one of his businesses. This increased value will move you from someone your possible mentor sees as merely a member of their audience to a member of their network. It\u2019s this critical step I see so many not do and it\u2019s the one strategic move that will most differentiate you from mentee potential to mentee personified. \n  5. Don\u2019t Ask For Mentorship, Make A Statement\nGoing back to the Sanberg quote above, you\u2019ll know your relationship is in the right place for formal mentorship when you don\u2019t have to \u201cask\u201d but simply say \u2013 \u201cyou\u2019re my mentor.\u201d I recall when I made this same statement to Ed, we were having dinner and towards the end I simply said \u201cthanks for being such a great mentor.\u201d That was 7 years of stellar guidance ago.\nFinding a great (formal) mentor can seem daunting, but start where you are. Begin through the inspiring people you\u2019re already interacting and working with now. Mentors need to be people to whom you have demonstrated your potential \u2013 who know how you think, act, communicate and contribute. And they have to like, trust and believe in you already (why else would they help you?).  They also need to believe with absolute certainty that you\u2019ll put to great use all their input and feedback."}, {"author": "Paul Carrick Brunson", "headline": "It\u2019s Called \u201cNetworking\u201d Not \u201cUsing\u201d", "body": "I worked for Oprah Winfrey and as a result, I've become popular for a particular favor. Daily. Seriously, every single day, I receive a message like the following (from someone I've never met):\n\u201cHi Paul, I\u2019m working on an incredible new project. Can you introduce me to Oprah so I can pitch it to her for funding or to partner with me?\u201d\nI wonder do they really expect my reply to be:\n\u201cSure, let me fire-off an email immediately to her and make an introduction.\u201d\nLet\u2019s get serious folks!\nThe biggest problem people have with networking is going in for the \u201cask\u201d too soon. If your networking strategy is simply about getting what you want, that\u2019s called \u201cusing\u201d not \u201cnetworking\u201d.\nKeep in mind the #1 rule of influence is reciprocity. Doing many somethings for the person you\u2019re building with before you make your ask will dramatically increase your ask getting answered.\nThe most successful relationships I have built are with people I do more for than they do for me. I give, give, give, give, give, then ask.\nSure, networking is about getting what you want but it\u2019s also about making sure the people who are important to you get what they want, too."}, {"author": "Paul Carrick Brunson", "headline": "I've Worked For Two Billionaires. Here's What I Learned From Them.", "body": "I have spent decades \u201cbeing educated\u201d \u2013  in college, graduate school, numerous professional certifications, and now a PhD program. All of that schooling and training helped shape the person I am today, but at no point in my life  has there been a more profound education than my time working for Enver Yucel and Oprah Winfrey.\nEnver and Oprah are two extraordinary people. And on top of that, they\u2019re both billionaires. On the surface, they appear to be totally different people. They are in different industries, have different family structures, practice different religions, and speak different languages. However, once you get past their written biographies and dig deeper, you will notice they possess many of the same successful habits.\nI had the opportunity to work with both Oprah and Enver for 6 years collectively and those were, hands down, the best professional experiences of my life. I worked my ass off for them and in doing so absorbed everything I could.\nIt\u2019s my honor to share with you what I learned from them. Here is Part 1 of the 20 successful habits I learned working for two billionaires:\n  1) Invest in Yourself\nThis is a very simple concept, but something you would think someone who has \u201cmade it\u201d would stop doing. Not at all for these two. I saw them both spend a significant amount of time dedicating their resources to self-development  (whether it be a new language, exercise, social media classes, etc). The moment you stop investing in yourself is the moment you have written off future dividends in life.\n  2) Be Curious\u2026About Everything\nWhat the average person sees as mundane or overly complicated is not viewed the same way with a billionaire mindset. I once had a 30 minute conversation with Enver about the height of the curbs in Washington DC versus Istanbul, Turkey.  Billionaires are incredibly curious; what the rest of the world thinks is a problem and complains about \u2014 that\u2019s what these people go and work on.\n  3) Surround Yourself With \u201cBetter\u201d People\nI hope this is why they kept me around :-). Seriously, I never knew my bosses to keep anyone less-than-stellar in their inner circle. There were many times I thought to myself, \u201cDamn, they have dream-teams built around them.\u201d Jim Rohn had it right, \u201cYou are the average of the 5 people you spend the most time with.\u201d\n  4) Never Eat Alone\nThe last time I had dinner with Enver, as well as the last time I ate dinner with Oprah, there were easily 15 people at our tables, respectively. Coincidence? While most of us derive our key information from blogs or the newspaper, power players get their information from the source (other power players), directly. However, just because you can\u2019t call up the Obamas and break bread with them doesn\u2019t mean eating with others in your circle doesn\u2019t carry value. In one of my favorite reads of the last few years called Never Eat Alone author Keith Ferrazzi breaks down how you can identify \u201cinformation brokers\u201d to dine with you.  I\u2019ve seen first hand how enormous the benefits are of this strategy.\n  5) Take Responsibility For Your Losses\nI was working for Oprah during the time she was taking heat from the media about poor network ratings. I was also working for Enver during the closing of one of his prized divisions. What I witnessed them both do in response was powerful. Opposed to covering the losses up with fancy PR tactics, both stepped to the stage and said in essence \u201cI own it and I\u2019m going to fix it\u201d and dropped the mic. Guess what?  They sure did fix things (It\u2019s widely noted Oprah\u2019s network is realizing ratings gold and Enver\u2019s assets have probably doubled since the division closing).\n  6) Understand The Power Of \u201cLeverage\u201d\nThis is something that was quite a shock to me. From afar, a billionaire appears to be someone who is a master at everything. But, in truth, they\u2019re specialists in one or a few areas and average or subpar at everything else. So, how do they get so much done? Leverage! They do what they do best and get others to do the rest . Here\u2019s a great article on leverage. Keep in mind I see this done with wealthy people and their money all of the time \u2013 they use OPM (other people\u2019s money) for most or all of their projects.\n  7) Take No Days Off (Completely)\nI recall going on vacation with Enver several times, yachting up and down the southwestern coast of Turkey (also known as the blue voyage). Sounds ballerific, right? No doubt we had a great time, but mixed in with all that swimming and backgammon was discussion of business, discussion of strategy, planning and plotting. The best way I can describe this habit is thinking about your business or your idea like your literal baby. No matter your distance, you don\u2019t stop thinking of him/her (and after just having a second son, I can attest to this).\n  8) Focus On Experiences vs. Material Possessions\nWhen you have money, your toys are big. However, the vast majority of money I saw spent on their \u201cleisure\u201d was on actual experiences versus the typical car, jewelry, and clothes we\u2019re familiar with seeing in music videos and gossip blogs. I recall one time at dinner with Oprah, I spotted a table of about 20 girls off to the side. I later found out Ms. Winfrey was treating some of her graduating girls from her school in South Africa to dinner in NYC. Experiences create memories, and memories are priceless.\n  9) Take Enormous Risks\nThis is another one of those successful habits every entrepreneur can attest to. A matter of fact, Entreprenuer.com created a great infographic outlining commonalities of the world\u2019s billionaires and one of the most prominent was this characteristic: billionaires are not adverse to risk. What intrigues me even more about Enver and Oprah was that even at their high financial status and success level, they still possessed a willingness to risk their most precious asset (their name and legacy) on new and bolder projects. If you\u2019re not taking risks, you\u2019re not making moves!\n  10) Don\u2019t Go At It Alone\nNothing great in life is achieved alone. Especially in business, success isn\u2019t a solo act. This character trait is akin to \u201csurrounding yourself with better people.\u201d It takes teamwork to make the dream work.\n  What I witnessed from working for Enver and Oprah were characteristics and successful habits that not only apply to business \u201cwins,\u201d but also translate to general life success. I sincerely hope the tips I\u2019ve shared here will inspire you to create (or maintain) great habits for your success.

Seriously, that\u2019s it. I have the privilege of sitting down one-on-one mostly with people I\u2019ve admired from afar \u2013 business leaders, artists, and change agents. But in a selfish move, to guard my memory of their work, I literally pray nothing will happen that will ruin my appreciation of them or their work.\n  So, when I sat down yesterday with legendary director Spike Lee for a one-on-one interview, I had the same hope. My memory of Spike goes back to his first feature length film \u2018She\u2019s Gotta Have It\u2019 and the one thing I\u2019ve never seen him do over the years is stand down from an issue. With a personality like his, an interview can become complicated because it takes cooperation to make for a good question and answer session. There needs to be willingness from both the interviewer and the interviewee to give and take. A good interview is like watching a couple flawlessly tango.\n  With my single hope, I was focused on doing everything within my control to make my interview with Spike Lee good. As I awaited for him on the set, alongside a group of about a dozen people, I began to think about all the things I had learned over the years in order to direct the interview along the questions and themes I had researched about him. Someone then entered the room and said \u201cSpike just arrived downstairs, he\u2019ll be up in 3 minutes!\u201d As the 3-minute countdown began in my head, I wasn\u2019t nervous, I was in the zone. An edge of super confidence even came over me. I began to think, forget about this simply being good, I would show Spike Lee what a GREAT interview really was. Well, I was ROYALLY mistaken! Little did I know, in 3 minutes, I would get a master class from Spike Lee.\n  Now, less than a full day after the interview, I remain in awe of what I witnessed Spike do, effortlessly. The techniques he used should be studied and considered if you are seeking to quickly place yourself in a position of power in a room of strangers or in an interview.\n  Here are the 10 things I learned from the legendary director Spike Lee on how to control a room (and an interview).\n  1. Have a Powerful Preceding Reputation\nThis is much easier said than done, but it made an impact in the room so I have to mention it. Everyone knows who Spike Lee is and most would agree his brand conjures up thoughts of: intelligence, creativeness, and defiance against the status quo. These descriptors were already on our minds before he entered the room and so, it played a part in his perception once we saw him. Remember that your reputation always precedes you. Control your brand, before you even think about controlling the room.\n  2. Walk in the Room Boldly\nThe moment Spike entered the room, he didn\u2019t stop walking until he landed at his interview chair. He moved with a sense of urgency. I\u2019ve watched countless other power players do the same. Not hesitating when you break the room\u2019s threshold gives the appearance of a true sense of purpose. When you enter a room, go to where you want to be and don\u2019t let anything or anyone interfere with you. Spike sure didn\u2019t.\n  3. Make Eye Contact With Everyone\nAs Spike walked to his chair, he appeared to be surveying the room. I didn\u2019t quite understand it until I saw him sit down. He was actually making eye contact with everyone, individually. There were only about a dozen of us in the room and Spike connected with each person. Most people in the room simply got a quick glance and slight smile, and while appearing minor, these two actions were significant. One of the most important nonverbal signals people use to size you up and figure out your intent is your facial expression. A slight smile and eye contact suggests you\u2019re approachable, but not overly eager.\n  4. Make it Clear You\u2019re On a Tight Timetable\nWhen Spike finished his room survey and sat down, he blurted out in a fun yet serious tone \u201cOkay my people, let\u2019s go, I have to be at \u2018The Daily Show\u2019 soon.\u201d In just a few words, he put everyone on notice that we had a strict deadline. Psychologically, creating a sense of urgency is a master move of a power player. Urgency causes people to act quickly because you stop thinking about the unnecessary and only concentrate on the critical. So all those extra camera shots and scenes we wanted to get with Spike got thrown out the window, he gave us a new mission, just focus on the main interview. It was at this exact moment that I believe Spike \u201ctook control\u201d of the room. He emerged as our leader (after only being in the room for a few minutes and uttering only a handful of words).\n  5. Reference Other Important Projects You\u2019re Involved With\nIf you notice in the prior point, Spike mentioned \u201cThe Daily Show.\u201d Was this by accident? Perhaps, but perhaps not. Strategically dropping a name is much different from bragging, with the latter being about your ego and the former being about the ego of those in the room with you. It\u2019s critical to talk yourself up. Who else is going to do it? Especially when you\u2019re working on important projects. It\u2019s how you manage your brand and in cases like \u201ccontrolling a room,\u201d it works wonders. There we were, the Our World Black Enterprise staff (an amazing TV team that puts on a quality show but we have no where near the budget, audience, or brand of The Daily Show\u2026at least, not yet :-)). So when Spike dropped such a high level brand, he added a sense of competitiveness to our urgency. This again was a great move. To be honest, it made me feel like I had to step up my game. I also felt humbled. Knowing my team and I were in the same media lineup of The Daily Show.\n  6. Be The First To Break The Ice\nWith Spike seated, it was my turn to take my place in the seat across from him. Once within eyesight, I gave him a smile, held out my hand and said \u201cIt\u2019s an honor to meet you Mr. Lee.\u201d I like to build a rapport with my interviewees before the start of the interview, so I was ready to launch into a pre-scripted ice breaker. I had prepared in my mind to ask Spike about the children\u2019s book he and his wife wrote. Especially, since my family owns a copy of the book and I had recently read it to my little boys. But before I could get out my words, with laser quickness, Spike asked me \u201cso, where did you go to school?\u201d I responded, \u201cOld Dominion for undergrad & Georgetown for grad.\u201d He then immediately asked, which team I preferred. I answered \u201cGeorgetown.\u201d As I finished pronouncing the \u201ctown\u201d in Georgetown, he started with his next question about my thoughts on the basketball coach. Long story short, this dude completely flipped the script on me!!! He was leading our pre-interview session. Guiding it where he wanted, at his own pace. Spike broke the ice first. \u201cBreaking the ice\u201d is basically the initial dialogue you have with someone, just the first 1 or 2 exchanges. From what I\u2019ve witnessed, whoever controls those first few exchanges, typically maintains control of the conversation going forward. In this case, Spike beat me to it. So after meeting him just seconds prior, before the camera even began to roll, the legendary director was already controlling the interview.\n  7. Use \u201cPower\u201d Body Language Moves\nOnce the official on air interview began (Spike yelled \u201cAction\u201d, by the way), I noticed something Spike was doing that I first mistook for coyness and later realized it was another masterful control move. We were both seated in swivel chairs and with the ease of a foot push, the chair would swivel from side to side. While I asked him questions, he sat in a squared off position with me \u2013 belly to belly. However, once my question was asked and we began to exchange on the topic, his foot would swivel his chair ever slightly away from me. From being someone who has studied body language for nearly a decade, I\u2019m aware that the movement of someone\u2019s belly button away from you suggests a disinterest but masterful Spike completely remixed this rule. He would focus on me, then move away, then focus on me again, then move away. It was very effective in making me feel as if at certain points I was losing his attention and therefore had to change the flow or subject in order to gain his attention back. He was making me work and controlling the topics of our conversation, by the slight push of his foot.\n  Another body language rule he used quite effectively was pointing his finger. However, instead of what you would typically think, that someone pointing a finger at you is offensive, Spike instead would point his finger upward. I\u2019ve actually not seen that move since I was a little boy and my mother was telling me \u201cno.\u201d By the simple point of his finger as I was talking, it politely signaled for me to pause. It was ridiculously effective and didn\u2019t feel as if he was being rude, at all. To experiment, I used the upward finger pointing move in 3 conversations since the interview and it\u2019s like a magic wand. Whoever you\u2019re talking to just automatically stops talking (I suggest using this sparingly).\n  8. Use the Power Pause\nGoogle any video interview of Spike and you\u2019ll see he does something with his delivery that few people do, especially on a televised interview. He pauses, at will. On TV, at live events, on podcasts, any situation with time limitations, people normally don\u2019t slow down, they actually speed up their cadence. Not only that, from advice I\u2019ve received from some of the best TV producers in the business, the key with interviews is to talk succinctly and drop quick (verbal) bombs \u2013 this reasoning comes from the fact TV is sound bite driven so if you say something quick and clever, chances are it\u2019ll make additional clips of the show (like a commercial tease). No person I\u2019ve ever interviewed has defied this law, except Spike Lee. The funny thing is that a \u201cpower pause\u201d is a technique many interviewers not interviewees use (I first learned about the power pause from watching Barbara Walters. She is notorious for asking a question, getting an answer, and not responding to the answer and like magic, the interviewee sensing the silence, delves deeper in their answer and gives up something they hadn\u2019t shared before). So with the power pause at his disposal, Spike had another tool to control the conversation.\n  9. Don\u2019t Use Fillers\u2026Ever.\nSpike delivered a filler free interview. The bottom line is that the use of \u201cumm,\u201d \u201cyeah,\u201d \u201clike,\u201d etc., destroys the appearance of confidence in your subject matter as well as yourself.\n  10. Make No Apologies\nName drop coming in 3, 2, 1\u2026I remember Oprah telling me that every person she ever interviewed asked her the same question afterwards, \u201cHow did I do?\u201d Over the past 2 years, having interviewed about 60 very prominent artists, business leaders, and change agents, that same question came up, as well. Inevitably, at some point after the interview, the interviewee would lean in close to me, nearly whispering and ask, \u201cPaul, how did I do?\u201d Yesterday, the streak ended. When our interview wrapped, Spike wished my Georgetown basketball team well, thanked me for the interview, and that was that.

Then, over many years, the ONE passion is developed and ultimately becomes ONE world class skill. Then, that ONE world class skill is applied and opens the doors to an endless number of opportunities to change the world.\nCase in point, meet Gilbert Tuhabonye.\nGilbert's ONE passion is running. Gilbert is a long distance runner born in Songa, Burundi, whose early love for track and field helped him win the Burundi National Championship in the men's 400 and 800 meters while only a junior in high school. This passion helped save his life.\nOn October 21, 1993, members of the Hutu tribe invaded Gilbert's high school and captured the students of the Tutsi tribe. Those not immediately killed were beaten and burned alive in a nearby building. After nine hours buried beneath burning bodies, Gilbert managed to escape and outrun his captors to the safety of a nearby hospital. He was the lone survivor.\nHe came to Texas and kept competing, honing his skills. Recruited by Abilene Christian University, Gilbert earned All-American honors six times.

Paradoxically, given the nature of its work, this is an area where one would assume that the most compassion in any society should be found. It does not add up. We need to reset our health and care services so they are fit for the 21st century.\nEveryone in Nigeria used to respect doctors and nurses. And why not? These are jobs that are as demanding as they are vital. Healthcare workers were seen as arbiters of life and death, a duty that was held sacred. But the endless cycle of strikes seem to be eroding much of this. While doctors, nurses, and other healthcare workers often have a genuine dissatisfaction with the facilities where they work, accessibility to drugs, and general conditions of service, the core issue at the heart of these strikes has been remuneration and status.\nPerhaps, it is time to expand this conversation beyond healthcare workers and government. Leaving it to healthcare workers and government in the past has only led to \u201ccollective bargaining agreements\u201d (CBAs) for improved wages and conditions of service that have been unsustainable. Government accedes to these collective agreements in the heat of each strike, and it quickly becomes obvious that it cannot fund the agreements, especially when other professions start agitating as well, and then we are back to square one, and a new cycle begins.\nAt the moment, there appears to be only one inevitable trajectory to the situation with strikes; more strikes, which lead to more disruption, which leads to more risks to the professional reputations of doctors and nurses, leading to more loss of public patience, and ultimately, this will inevitably lead to the failure of the public sector healthcare delivery system. Without radical reforms, it is hard to see how the current management arrangement of tertiary hospitals in Nigeria will survive. Just like NEPA and NITEL, we have started our descent.\nWe do not realise the damage done by strikes in our context because no one bothers to count. When junior doctors working in the UK\u2019s National Health Service (NHS) went on strike for two days recently, the first time this was happening in its history, it led to the cancellation of 125,000 operations and appointments. In Nigeria, strikes continue for months, with associated loss of life and income. If we counted the damage done by strikes in Nigeria, there would be widespread outrage.\nPicture credit: Orodata\nThe time has come to have a deeper conversation on the impact of strikes by health care workers on the lives of Nigerians. Nigerians can no longer afford to leave this to the professionals and the government to resolve. The Government is there to represent us, by allocating our common resources to pay health workers to provide care for us. It is time for us to raise our voices and assess how both our government and the healthcare workers employed on our behalf are fulfilling their responsibilities to us.\nIn order to achieve success, and stop this alarming descent, we must urgently commence an Indaba, a conversation process, whose recommendations must lead to implementation, and not be shelved like the many previous ones. We must find some eminent and credible Nigerians to lead this conversation. It will have to be led by someone outside of the key medical professions because of the loss of trust among health sector professionals.  During this Indaba, we must address some of the most fundamental issues facing the sector, which we have chosen to overlook over the years. There are five critical points that we think must be addressed:\nIntroduce accountability into patient-care - There must be a relationship between salaries in public sector hospitals and outcomes. Outcomes have to include both process outcomes, such as numbers of patients seen, clinical outcomes, as well as patient satisfaction. As long as there is no form of accountability in the sector, the only source of motivation to work is healthcare workers\u2019 altruism, which unfortunately is not sufficient in our context.\nUnderstand the appropriate doctor/nurse to patient ratio appropriate for each department in our tertiary hospitals - The situation at the moment where a single tertiary hospital has upwards of 20 consultants in a single department, and a handful in other departments, unrelated to activity, is simply unsustainable. Over the past few years, the government has continued hiring staff without any analysis of need or any understanding of workload. It is no surprise that they end up being unable to pay.\nDe-centralise salaries - Every tertiary hospital in Nigeria currently arranges its own procurement of everything from paracetamol to equipment. There is absolutely no point anymore for a uniform salary structure from Port Harcourt to Potiskum, from Abeokuta to Damaturu, when the circumstances, cost of living, work load and almost every criteria to determine pay is radically different across Nigeria. Trying to sustain a uniform pay band across Nigeria might provide for equality but definitely not equity.\nMake every tertiary hospital in Nigeria publish its accounts - In tertiary hospitals, the \u201cChief Medical Directors\u201d are Chief Executives with un-paralleled powers. Every decision begins and ends with them. Other than the annual publication of budgets, no one knows how much money they get from the Federal Government, from the National Health Insurance Scheme, from fee-paying patients or how much they are spending. Let Nigerians know how much of their money is going to salaries, medicines, equipment, etc.\nImplement that National Health Act \u2013 The new National Health Act provides for the establishment of a National Tertiary Health Institutions Standard Committee that would regulate tertiary health facilities, providing guidelines for the use of Tertiary Hospital Management Boards. If this is implemented, and hospitals held publicly accountable to its implementation, this will make the consequences of strikes much more immediate for each hospital.\nWe have always held the opinion at Nigeria Health Watch that strikes should be an extreme last option for healthcare workers.  A strike means walking out on our patients, leaving them in the ICUs and emergency rooms. We recognise the challenges that many Nigerian healthcare workers face, trying to deliver care in a context where many of the basic functions of society are broken or non-existent; and the responsibility of the employer to the employed. But we also believe that a person choosing healthcare as a profession must examine their motivation and understand the choices that they make.\nIt is time for this conversation to happen, or else our descent will continue, and it may just reach the point\u2026 of no-return."}, {"author": "Chikwe Ihekweazu", "headline": "On World Tuberculosis Day - Reflections on a Forgotten Epidemic", "body": "March 24 was World TB Day, yet for most people that have the privilege of reading this piece, tuberculosis is an abstract term.\nWhy would a disease that infects about half a million Nigerians every year, and kills about 170,000 annually attract so little attention from the government, the health professions and from the people? The answer is simple \u2013 it is a disease that disproportionately affects the poor and marginalised. It is widely recognised that the poorer the community, the greater the likelihood of being infected with the TB germ and developing clinical disease. A lack of basic health services, poor nutrition, inadequate living conditions and HIV all contribute to the spread of TB. With poor access to health services to diagnose or treat patients, there is a longer delay between disease and treatment, perpetuating the spread of TB. In a hyper-capitalist society like Nigeria, it is not hard to see why patients with tuberculosis fall through the cracks.\nThe first challenge in Nigeria, as with many other things, is to understand the size of the problem. Over the past four years, about 100,000 cases of all forms of TB were diagnosed in health centres across the country. However, in 2012/13, the National Tuberculosis and Leprosy Control Programme (NTLCP), under the leadership of Dr. Olusegun Obasanya at the time, conducted the first ever population based national prevalence survey, which revealed some shocking results.\nThe estimated overall prevalence was double what was being counted and the incidence (rate of new cases) a year was three times previous estimates. Assuming a resident population of 170 million in Nigeria, the estimated number of new cases of all forms of TB would be about 570,000, revealing a huge gap in case detection. This showed that Nigeria\u2019s case detection rate for all forms of TB currently stood at only 15 percent, one of the lowest case detection rates in the world.\nFor the cases that are detected, they are almost exclusively managed in the public sector, and the management of TB has been generally limited to \"Directly Observed Treatment Short course\" (or \u201cDOTS\u201d) centres and \u201cChest Clinics\u201d, a practice that belongs in the dark ages. Contemporary science suggests that there is no medical or public health reason why patients with TB should be diagnosed and managed in any out-patient setting separate from any other patient. Mycobacterium tuberculosis is such a poorly virulent organism that the risk of transmission in an outpatient clinic in our context is minimal. This practice has led to a whole generation of doctors who have little experience in how to manage patients with TB, because all they do is refer to \"DOTS\" centres. It is time to change this and normalise TB treatment, by bringing it back into primary health centres in Nigeria. The national TB strategic plan (2015 \u2013 2020) suggests an expansion of DOTS services to more facilities across the country in order to improve case notification rates. We suggest going a step further: make every public healthcare facility in Nigeria a \u201cDOTS Centre\u201d. Every functional public health care facility should have the capacity and resources to manage patients with TB.\nHowever, to get TB cases into care, they need to be diagnosed. This is being addressed to some extent by the roll of out of the Xpert MTB/RIF assay (carried out in \u201cGeneXpert machines\u201d) in Nigeria. The Xpert MTB/RIF assay is a new test that is changing tuberculosis (TB) diagnosis by enabling the rapid diagnosis of TB disease and drug resistance. The test simultaneously detects Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex (MTBC) and resistance to rifampin (RIF) in less than 2 hours. In comparison, standard cultures can take 2 to 6 weeks for MTBC to grow and conventional drug resistance tests can add 3 more weeks. Up to the end of 2015,there are just over 200 centres with GeneXpert machines in Nigeria. The policy has recently been changed to allow the use of Xpert MTB/RIF assay for the diagnoses of all potential TB cases without restrictions, where the test is available. The GeneXpert equipment is however very expensive, and these costs go way beyond the initial costs. This paper by Abdurrahman et al showed that the \u201chidden\u201d costs of installing these machines could be up to 3 times the cost of the machines themselves. In addition, because these rely heavily on constant electricity to work, their utility is limited to centres where this is available. Of the 200 centres in Nigeria, most are in the public sector, with 22 being in the private sector; predominantly faith-based not-for-profit hospitals. This March, the NTBLCP in collaboration with USAID conducted an assessment of the TB laboratory diagnostic capacity in Nigeria, including laboratory infrastructure, technology and human resources. The results from this will further guide the efforts to increase case detection in Nigeria.\nNigeria has the fourth highest annual number of TB cases in the world. We cannot get on top of this by passive detection of TB as is currently the case. Studies such as this one by Oshi et al shows that intensified case finding combined with capacity building, provision of work guidelines, and TB health education can improve TB notification.\nFor World TB Day 2016, WHO calls on governments, communities, civil society, and the private sector to \"Unite to End TB\". WHO and partners are promoting dialogue and collaboration that unites individuals and communities in new ways to end the tuberculosis (TB) epidemic. These efforts cut across disciplines and sectors, and can help accelerate progress towards the Sustainable Development Goals overall by contributing to other areas including poverty elimination, universal health coverage, maternal and child health, social protection and justice. The World Health Organizations\u2019s End TB Strategy envisions a world free of TB with zero deaths, disease and suffering. It sets targets and outlines actions for governments and partners to provide patient-centred care, pursue policies and systems that enable prevention and care, and drive research and innovations needed to end the epidemic and eliminate TB.\nEvery country is judged by how it treats its most vulnerable. Maybe it's time for us to stand up for ours. We can #EndTB, but we must reach the most vulnerable!\nWatch this short documentary on Drug resistant Tuberculosis on the rise in Nigeria."}, {"author": "Chikwe Ihekweazu", "headline": "Lack of trust in health sector: the underlying cause of the large Lassa Fever outbreak in Nigeria", "body": "Strange deaths in a community in Niger State in 2015 left the community confused, this was followed by a period of uncertainty and anxiety, and they reached out to the only rational explanation they could imagine \u2013 the supernatural. By the time the public health authorities were informed and a diagnosis of Lassa Fever was made, the outbreak had spread to many states. Control efforts included a mixture of persuasion to report suspicious cases to health authorities, establishment of task teams, and even an emergency meeting of the National Council of Health. One patient is reported to have \u201cescaped\u201d the hospital where he was being treated. The community was scared; they did not know who to trust.\nThe Nigerian Centre for Disease Control is evolving and Prof. Abdulsalami Nasidi has promised that its new Reference Laboratory in Kaduwa, Abuja will be ready for commissioning soon. On a morning television broadcast on the Nigerian Television Authority on the 20th of January he praised the efforts of the seven diagnostic centres in the country and promised to redouble control efforts. Colleagues in the Nigerian Field Epidemiology Training Programme are supporting the response.  As an epidemiologist myself, there is little that will make me prouder than a vibrant, professional Centre for Disease Control in Nigeria.\nHowever, the reality of this Lassa Fever outbreak, and all outbreaks that I have worked on in my many years as an infectious diseases epidemiologist have taught me that while epidemiology and diagnostic capacity are important components of health security, the most important line of defense may not be improved technology or quicker response times by my colleagues \u2013 epidemiologists, virologists, clinicians or surveillance officers.\nThe single most important factor in the control of outbreaks is trust in the health care system by the citizens of a country. A great \u201cCentre for Disease Control\u201d, is worth very little in the context of a public health care system that is largely dysfunctional, which its citizens do not trust.\nA lack of trust would not have prevented a few cases of Ebola emerging, but it was at the centre of the exponential spread of the Ebola outbreak in Liberia, Guinea and Sierra Leone, and at the heart of the challenges we faced during the response that I participated in, on the ground in Liberia. The need to focus on building trust in communities, and with their health care system is the most important lesson that I learnt from the response to the Ebola outbreak. A lack of trust in the public health care system is the most important reason the current Lassa Fever outbreak continues to spread.\nThe most likely transmission mechanism for the current Lassa Fever outbreak is person-to-person transmission. While rats are the likely source of initial infection, it is extremely unlikely, given the geographical distribution of cases that there is any on-going zoonotic source of infection. Therefore, to break the chains of transmission of the Lassa Fever virus, people must trust the health authorities enough to inform them of any signs of illness and not seek alternative sources of relief. Those infected and affected must trust that the healthcare workers\u2019 that they report to will treat them and care for them humanely in the presence of overwhelming historical evidence to the contrary.\nWhen a potential Lassa Fever patient declines to go into a primary health centre or hospital for care, this is often described as \u201cirrational\u201d and \u201cillogical\u201d behavior. Yet in the past the same healthcare workers have often failed to care for his child who had severe malaria, or failed to prevent the death of a sister following child birth? How could he be expected to suddenly trust the same health care worker that was never in his/her clinic all these years when he needed them?\nWhen this outbreak is over, the most likely scenario in Nigeria will be the re-start of the celebratory mode of the post Ebola period, rather than a period of introspection and retrospection. We will make speeches and pat ourselves on the back. However, this \u2018outbreak narrative\u2019 fails to capture the complexity of the underlying factor, trust, which I believe is largely responsible for the rapid spread and failure of initial control attempts of this outbreak. If we continue business as usual, we must expect the next outbreak pretty soon.\nThe most important line of defense for us in Nigeria is to rebuild our confidence in the capacity of our government to prioritize the health to its citizens.  This will require a complete turnaround in our health systems\u2019 capacity to respond to the \u201croutine\u201d health needs of a population. It is only by responding to these in \u201cpeacetime\u201d and building trust, will we have the capacity to respond better to the next crisis. Trust in our health systems will not prevent outbreaks (outbreaks of infectious diseases will always be with us), but it would most likely have prevented large outbreaks like the Lassa Fever one that we are experiencing. To do this, we need the Nigerian government to earn the confidence of its citizens in their ability to serve their interests and protect them.\nAs an infectious disease epidemiologist, my career has been built around measuring infectious disease burdens, determining trends, assessing risk factors and measuring the impact of control measures; this is my comfort zone. But I have learned that not everything that can be measured matters \u2013 and not everything that matters can be measured.\nTrust exemplifies this. When a society loses confidence in those to whom they would normally turn to in times of need, they resort to actions that can be generally considered \u201cirrational\u201d and illogical\u201d and unwittingly spread the disease further. Recognising this limitation has changed the way I view the relevance of my profession in the context of outbreak control. Learning from and applying this knowledge will be the most critical challenge of the post Lassa Fever outbreak period.\nNigerians, want their existing primary health centres to work. Only when trust is restored in the capabilities and compassion of the public health system can we hope to prevent large outbreaks from occurring. Restoring trust in existing primary health centres is much more important today than building 10,000 new ones."}, {"author": "Chikwe Ihekweazu", "headline": "Before the SDGs, how did Nigeria really do with the MDGS?", "body": "  By Chikwe Ihekweazu\nNigeria Health Watch\n\nIn August 2015, reports emerged in the Nigerian press that \u201cNigeria had attained the Millennium Development Goals\u201d.  The article above the Secretary of Programmes in the Office of the Senior Special Assistant to the President on MDGs, Mr. Ogenyi Ochapa, verbatim, with no critical commentary on the validity of his statement, which boldly declared: Nigeria has Attained HIV, Maternal Mortality MDGs ahead of Deadline!\nLate in September 2015, almost everyone in the Nigerian health establishment was in New York for the UN General Assembly (UNGA). It was at a side event of the UNGA, at the United Nations headquarters, that the country\u2019s final status report on the implementation of the Millennium Development Goals was released. We have tried to find out if there was a subsequent event in Nigeria to share this report with the Nigerian people, to no avail.\nOther than a few reports on the meeting in September, there has been almost no reportage on the report, or its outcomes. The entire development community has moved on to the new Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).One reason for this may be that the report itself is almost impossible to find. This most important report that describes the outcomes of a project that Nigeria and all supporting development partners invested billions of Naira is not on the website of the \u201cOffice of the Special Assistant to the President on MDGs\u201d as at the last time we accessed it, which was today, 10/11/15.\nBut it is important that we know if the \u201cGoals\u201d were achieved and what the outcomes of our investments were. So, we got hold of the MDGs End-Point Report and encourage you to read it.\nFirst, let\u2019s remind ourselves on what the Millennium Development Goals were meant to be. In 2000, at the United Nations Millennium Summit, 189 world leaders, including Nigeria\u2019s, adopted the Millennium Declaration to overcome poverty through a set of eight mutually reinforcing interrelated time-bound goals (MDGs) with related targets. One of the stated objectives of the \u201cGoals\u201d was to provide an \u201caccountability framework\u201d. The attractiveness of having goals is that simple statements can be made and communicated on if they were achieved or not. The MDGs were at the forefront of the global development agenda to eradicate poverty by 2015.\nIn Nigeria, as we do, in 2005 we created the Office of the Senior Special Assistant to the President on the Millennium Development Goals with Directors, Officers and a huge budget to provide guidance, coordination and oversight on the attainment of the MDGs.\nThere are eight goals, but for the purposes of our platform, lets examine how Nigeria did, from the report of the Office of the Senior Special Assistant, on the 3 health-related goals and associated targets; Goals 4, 5 and 6.\nGoal 4: Reduce Child Mortality \u2013 Target: Reduce by two-thirds, between 1990 and 2015, the under-five mortality rate. None of the indicators for this target; under-five mortality rate, infant mortality rate and the proportion of one year-old children immunized against measles were met in Nigeria.\nGoal 5: Improve Maternal Health \u2013 Target: Reduce by three-quarters, between 1990 and 2015, the maternal mortality ratio. The first indicator is on maternal mortality ratio, which the report says that Nigeria has met \u2013 from a baseline figure of 1000 deaths per 100,000 live births in 1990 to its end-point status of 243 per 100,000 live births in 2014.\nHowever this is contradicted by data from the Demographic and Health Survey done in Nigeria in 2013 and carried out by the National Population Commission and partners, which reported that the maternal mortality ratio in 2013 was 576 deaths per 100,000 births, an insignificant difference from the 2008 finding of 545 deaths per 100,000 births.\nDraw your own conclusions. None of the other indicators; proportion of births attended by skilled health personnel, unmet need for family planning, and antenatal care coverage were met.\nGoal 6: Combat HIV and AIDS, malaria and other diseases \u2013 Target: Have halted, by 2015, and begun to reverse the spread of HIV and AIDS. None of the nine indicators relating to HIV, TB and Malaria were met and on TB specifically, incident rates are actually increasing.\nIn summary, of the 16 indicators relating to three Millennium Development Goals relating to health, 15 were not met and only one was met. The one that was met, relating to maternal mortality is contradicted by data from a report considered to be the industry standard for that indicator, also commissioned by the same government.\nGranted, the MDGs were ambitious, and granted there has been some progress on many of the indicators, but there is really nothing to celebrate considering the funds invested by the Nigerian Government and development partners on behalf of the Nigerian people.\nBefore going full steam into committing funds to the new Sustainable Development Goals, it would be prudent to do a critical review on the approach taken by Nigeria. This is especially important as the government reaches conclusions on whether setting up a mini-parastatal as in the \u201cOffice of the Senior Special Assistant to the President on the Millennium Development Goals\u201d that was constructing buildings and boreholes across the country was the right approach rather than investing in the public institutions with a mandate to carry out these functions.\nWith a new government in place in Nigeria, just at the time the new SDGs have been agreed, there is no better time to ask these questions."}, {"author": "Chikwe Ihekweazu", "headline": "One year later, 5 most important lessons from the Nigerian Ebola Response ", "body": "By Chikwe Ihekweazu\nNigeria Health Watch\nOn October 20 2014, almost exactly one year ago, the World Health Organisation declared Nigeria Ebola free, 42 days after the last known case had occurred. At the time the world was in the grip of one of the largest and most terrifying public health disasters in generations.\nWhile not completely over, there are signs that we are finally getting to the end of this outbreak which has had an unprecedented impact on the sub-continent. The Ebola outbreak claimed thousands of people, including hundreds of doctors and health care workers and it will be a tragedy of immense proportions if lessons are not learnt and history repeats itself. While we wait for our governments and schools of public health to engage with this process, we offer a starting point of the reflection that should be happening across the country and continent.\nCompared to the three most affected countries, Nigeria had a relatively small outbreak. As the outbreak escalated in Liberia, Guinea and Sierra Leone, there was significant anxiety on the consequences of the introduction of the virus to Lagos, with its estimated population of 15 million, living in densely populated neighbourhoods. In many ways Nigeria was lucky that its first case entered the country through the main airport and presented to one of the most recognised private hospitals in Lagos. Here, the astute clinical acumen and professionalism of the staff of First Consultants Hospital Group led to the rapid diagnosis of Ebola and the sheer determination of its excellent group of clinicians prevented the patient from leaving the hospital at his request, most probably saving the country from many more infections. This was done at great personal sacrifice, with many of the team paying the ultimate price with their lives.\nSubsequently, the country experienced probably its finest hours in public health by rapidly mobilising the resources to mount a determined response. The rest is history, as the country managed to limit the number of cases to 19 with 10 deaths, confounding the predictions of doom that had spread around the world. Nigeria saved itself not only from a major public health crisis but also an economic one, as the consequences of exclusion from the global economy would have been a disastrous outcome for the country.\nOne year after the outbreak, it is important for the country to reflect both on what was achieved and how it was achieved, but most importantly we must ponder whether  the lessons learnt have formed the basis for the prevention of future outbreaks and the preparation of a more robust response in the future. We hope that the Federal Ministry of Health and its National Centre for Disease Control has carried out a similar exercise, or if not, that this piece inspires them to do so. We propose these five areas below as those that enabled the successful response in Nigeria and therefore should be further developed.\nCentral coordination through an \u201cEmergency Operations Centre\u201d (EOC)\nNigeria\u2019s rapid response to the introduction of Ebola benefited from having an established EOC that was funded and set up by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation to support the response towards the elimination of polio in Nigeria. The deputy incident manager of the polio EOC was rapidly deployed to lead theEbola EOC (watch a great interview with Dr Faisal Shuaib by Ebola Deeply). Nigerian authorities moved quickly to establish a co-ordinated response using EOC structures previously developed for its polio response and drew from its experience in setting up strict command and control structures to manage the response.\nAmong its activities, the team coordinated the follow up of thousands of contacts, developed a staffing plan that executed a social mobilization strategy that reached more than 26,000 households of people living around the contacts of Ebola patients, and ensured that resources required for the clinical management of cases were available. A number of partners from WHO, CDC, UNICEF and MSF were part of the EOC structure, however all reporting and communication was done through the incident manager appointed by the Ministry of Health for this purpose.  After the Ebola response using EOCs in Lagos and Port Harcourt, its core structure was moved to Abuja to maintain contingency arrangements. This has since faded away quietly. It is not clear what proactive steps the country is taking to sustain an operational EOC, nor where this would be located.\nThe public health function of the private hospitals\nIt is difficult to overstate the critical role that a culture of strong clinical governance and an awareness of public health responsibility played in shaping the response of the First Consultants Hospital Group in Lagos to the Ebola outbreak, led by Dr Adadevoh and her team . Population health as proposed by Kindig et al is a concept of health that focuses on \u201cthe health outcomes of a group of individuals, including the distribution of such outcomes within the group,\u201d and includes health outcomes, patterns of health determinants, and policies and interventions that link these two. Population health is primarily a goal\u2014a goal of achieving measurable improvements in the health of a defined population. Therefore it is important not only for those responsible for the health of populations, but for all those working in hospitals and clinics with a responsibility to deliver care to understand concepts such as prevalence, incidence, risk, and disease determinants at a population level in order to practise to a high level. If Dr Adadevoh and her team were not acutely knowledgeable on this, Nigeria would have ended up with a completely different outbreak. Dr. Ada Ighonoh, a young doctor at the hospital who survived Ebola, gave a personal account of how she survived and how she is using her second chance at life to prepare herself to prevent similar incidents from happening in the future. Every doctor should listen, and learn.\nCommunication matters more than ever during outbreaks\nDuring the outbreak, the media was saturated with messages on Ebola. It was on every media, on television, radio, on newspapers on social media. Suddenly there were Ebola experts everywhere and people were rapidly educated on the risks of the disease, the symptoms and what to do if one had symptoms. But this was not the case in the beginning of the outbreak, when stories on remedies such as \u201csalt water\u201d, \u201cbitter kola\u201d and \u201cNano Silver\u201d filled the airwaves as we clutched at straws, filled with anxiety. A completely volunteer group, EbolaAlert led by Dr Lawal Bakare rose out of Nigeria to be one of the most credible sources of information on Ebola. Led by young Nigerians, they quickly garnered over sixty thousand followers on twitter. At this time, there was virtually no usable information on the website of the Federal Ministry of Health and the Nigerian Centre for Disease Control did not and still does not have a website through which it can inform the population. The impact of poor communication was demonstrated acutely during the recent apparent Ebola\u201cscare\u201d in Calabar.\nInvesting in training and development: The National Field Epidemiology Training Programme example.\nA few years ago, with the support of the US CDC, the Field Epidemiology and Laboratory Training Program (FELTP) was set up in Nigeria.  This is a two-year competency-based training and service program in applied epidemiology and public health that builds the capacity to strengthen the surveillance and response systems of a country. It is managed by the Federal Ministry of Health, the Federal Ministry of Agriculture, in partnership with the University of Ibadan and Ahmadu Bello University in Zaria. The programme trains medical epidemiology residents, public health laboratory residents, and veterinary epidemiology residents for leadership positions. The field epidemiology component is similar to programs that have been established in more than 30 countries. Itis modeled after the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\u2019s (CDC) two-year Epidemic Intelligence Service (EIS) training program and is composed of 25% course work and 75% field work. Current and past fellows of the programme who were already trained in most of the requisite skills formed the bedrock of the contact tracing and case investigation teams during the Nigerian response. Having this cohort of experts readily available is a testament to the importance of investing in developing skills for the future.\n      5. Leadership\nThe leadership provided by the then Minister of Health, Professor Onyebuchi Chukwu, the then Governor of Lagos State, Babatunde Fashola, SAN, and his Commissioner for Health, Dr. Jide Idris were critical in controlling the outbreak. Despite some initial disagreements in approach, they maintained a collaborative framework in agreeing strategy and communication, recognising the lead responsibility of the Federal Government during major outbreak situations. They worked together to prevent the doomsday scenario of the rapid spread of the disease predicted in Nigeria. The function of leadership is not however limited to the public sector leaders but across the entire chain of command to the so-called \u201cboots on the ground\u201d that went house to house diligently following up on all the contacts.\nIronically, at the time of the outbreak, doctors working in public hospitals across Nigeria were on strike. This probably represents the biggest area of public sector leadership failure  in the health sector over the last decade.\nThere are definitely many other lessons that the outbreak has taught us, here we have offered our top five. Evaluations are only consequential if their results lead to change and improvement. There has been a lot of chest beating on the successful Nigerian response, now it is time to prepare for the future."}, {"author": "Chikwe Ihekweazu", "headline": "Three reasons Strikes will continue in Nigeria\u2019s Health Sector", "body": "No part of public service in Nigeria has experienced more strikes than the health sector.\nRight now, public tertiary hospitals in Nigeria are struggling to get back to life after another series of strikes. The University College Hospital, Ibadan, was crippled for 108 days by a strike called by the Association of Resident Doctors. At LAUTECH Oshogbo, a strike closed the hospital for 5 months, and in the Psychiatric Hospital in Yaba, doctors walked away from their duty posts leaving their patients to their own means.  The story of the Federal Medical Centre in Owerri is already legendary, as health workers came to \u201cwork\u201d every day but spent their time singing and praying on the hospital grounds, while ignoring their patients in the wards, protesting against the privatisation of some of the hospitals services. Their strike lasted for three months.\nThis story map details the major health sector strikes in 2015.\nLast year, many public sector hospitals across the country were closed for about half of the year following strikes as doctors refused to return to work, even during the Ebola outbreak. Almost as soon as they returned, other health sector workers under the aegis of the Joint Health Sector Unions (JOHESU) proceeded to strike from November 2014 to February 2015.\nWhen there are strikes in public sector hospitals, there are only two constituencies that suffer: a) the patients, and b) the tax-payer (i.e. you and I), who do not get a service that is paid for on our behalf by government. Other health workers not on strike all collect their full salaries and allowances, the health workers on strike are ultimately paid in most cases, and even the hospital still gets its normal allocation from the Federal Ministry of Health as well as its quarterly \u201callocation\u201d from the National Health Insurance Scheme, whether any of its\u2019 patients covered by the scheme received clinical care during that quarter or not. So, for health workers and hospitals there are few, if any, consequences from strikes.\nAs professional bodies in the health sector prepare for strike actions, they tend to make three assumptions which make the decision so easy in Nigeria. Below we examine these assumptions and highlight how they may not continue to hold in the future:\nGovernment will always settle, eventually: Let\u2019s tell ourselves the simple truth. Government has always settled. Not only have they always settled, they have not asked or received anything tangible in return.  Salaries have increased without any change to the quality of service delivered. The complexity of health and measuring impact makes accountability difficult. So, unlike in most other contexts, no doctor working in the public sector in Nigeria has a contract or specification that states what the clinical expectations are in terms of the service he/she is delivering.  There are no contracts with surgeons that state how many cases they are contracted to do, or how many patients physicians are expected to see. This also applies to other categories of health workers; and crucially also applies at institutional level. There are no process indicators, no quality indicators, no outcome indicators and definitely no patient satisfaction indicators. We do not know how many patients each public health facility is expected to see or what standard of service they are supposed to deliver. So there is absolutely no way for government (us) to know if we are getting value for money. We can pay salaries as high as we like, but until we link pay and funding to performance, nothing will change.  Although this has never happened, it is only a matter of time, until government starts asking for value for money from the sector.\nThe patients will always return: This is an assumption that we are glad to say is already being proven wrong. Patients will not always return, even those at the poorer end of the socioeconomic spectrum. A tour round many of the teaching and other public hospitals will reveal that many beds are empty, and increasingly so. There is a quiet evolution going on in the private health care sector in Nigeria. Previously, the sector was inherently inefficient with many two to four bed hospitals, whose ineffective management tended to charge over-the-top fees for the handful of patients unfortunate enough to end up in their care. This is changing, as a series of innovative groups are pulling together resources to build clinical collaborations that will enable high utilisation of services, lower costs and better care in the private sector.  Once this gains momentum, there will be less and less of a reason to go to many of the public sector hospitals. It will only be a matter of time for government to realise that they cannot continue funding these hospitals, when patients seek their care elsewhere.  Money will begin to follow the patient.\nStriking workers will always return to their jobs: This is the strongest of all the assumptions. However, staff of NITEL and NEPA also once thought that they would always have their jobs. If there are insufficient patients in most public sector hospitals and these hospitals are forced to close, the inevitable consequence is that there will simply be nothing to do in them. This is a natural consequence; it can be slowed, but cannot be stopped.\nThere are only two possible end points for the scenario playing out in the Nigerian public health care sector at the tertiary level; complete disintegration of the publicly delivered tertiary health care (similar to what happened with NITEL, NEPA) or a complete turn around. As it stands, the health  sector is surely and firmly walking towards self-destruction.  Too many health professions in Nigeria are so focused on their professional interests and egos that they seem to have lost sight of the bigger picture. In fighting for the ball, we are destroying it. If this continues, the outcome is inevitable. There will be nothing left to fight over.\nThe need has never been greater for real leadership to emerge from the professional bodies that will be willing to put the patient as the client front and centre of their action. There may only be a tiny window of opportunity to change course. Chances are that it is already too late\u2026 and that the downward spiral is well on its way.\nStill, we grasp for even a hint of light at the end of the tunnel, that our hopes may rise once again."}, {"author": "Chikwe Ihekweazu", "headline": "Can technology-based measurement transform the Nigerian Health Sector?", "body": "Can technology-based measurement transform the Nigerian Health Sector?\n0\nBy Chikwe Ihekweazu on Africa Diaspora Health Nigeria Technology\nThe Nigerian Banking Sector is almost unrecognizable compared to where it was just a few years ago. As a consumer, you can get cash from almost any ATM in Nigeria, transact business in any bank, pay for goods by mobile phone, and confirm transactions in seconds. You have access to statements 24/7, at least as long as there is connectivity. In addition to increasing the ease of transactions, the other major impact of these changes has been increased accountability and transparency, not just for the banks but for every individual or firm using bank services.\nIn contrast, our public sector hospitals these days seem to be constantly shut as one of several groups of health professionals is almost always on strike. While we may guess, we really do not know the impact this has on the Nigerian Health Sector. It is almost impossible to get data on how many surgeries surgeons actually carry out in our teaching hospitals or how many deliveries the midwives have performed in a month. What if we knew how many contact-hours medical students had with patients before being released to the world with that god-like title of \u201cDoctor\u201d? Would it make a difference to the perception we have of our apparently great healthcare institutions if we actually knew what they were \u201cproducing\u201d per naira of funds allocated? As budgets tighten for our governments, these questions will get even louder because healthcare is an expensive business. The biggest irony of all salary negotiations with health sector professionals in Nigeria is that they take place in the absence of any data on productivity.\nI have been reading about one of the greatest technology personalities of our time, more so since his interest in the health sector has grown; Bill Gates. One philosophy of his that has stuck with me is his reputed obsession for measurement. In his annual letter in 2013, Gates makes the case for how measurement has driven some of the biggest recent public health successes of this era. There is no doubt that improved data collection and sharing in Nigeria has been critical to the recent progress on polio in Nigeria.\nIncreasing accountability, efficiency and profitability in the health sector is not possible without the tools for measurement. Technology, especially mobile, has the power to transform the delivery of healthcare services and improve compliance, accountability and care. Driven by some of the fastest mobile subscriber growth in the world, cheaper mobile devices, and continued innovation, emerging mobile health solutions are already saving lives \u2013 an estimated 1 million of them by 2017, according to a recentreport by PricewaterhouseCoopers.\nDespite the growing interest in Mobile Health (mHealth) initiatives globally, adoption rates of mobile solutions has been slow in Nigeria. An emerging opportunity exists for healthcare providers to adopt mobile technology to not only to improve the effectiveness of healthcare delivery but to also measure and demonstrate results.\nWhile the sector is eager for mHealth solutions, most care providers in Nigeria still lack the required infrastructure to support widespread deployment of apps that might integrate personal medical information. Healthcare organisations will need to start from the basics, e.g. the deployment of Electronic Medical Records (EMR) systems, from which relevant data can be extracted and integrated into mobile health apps. When you consider that one of the major hospital groups in Nigeria, Lagoon hospitals only announced a full adoption of electronic medical records in 2013, it demonstrates how far the distance still is. Most medical records of patients in Nigeria are stored in folders as shown below.\nPaper Records at a Nigerian Hospital\nOne firm that is making progress in this space is Sabaoth Technologies Ltd, an all-purpose medical information systems firm, which is currently providing hospital information management systems to the Delta State University Teaching Hospital, Oghara and University College Hospital Ibadan in the public sector as well as several private hospitals.\nThere are other firms now making inroads into the health space. If you have not heard about the IT and logistics platform Integrahealth, note the name. Their flagship product \u2018DrugStock\u2019 enables the purchase of good quality drugs, managing the supply chain, payments, and capacity building for medium size hospitals mostly in Lagos, Nigeria. The co-founder Chibuzor Opara was at the World Economic Forumthis year speaking about their dream of increasing efficiency of hospitals in Nigeria and beyond.\nEarly in 2015, the Private Sector Health Alliance hosted \u201cThe Health Innovation Challenge;\u201d a multi-stage competition to recognise, reward and celebrate innovations that show potential to improve health in Nigeria. Several innovative firms and ideas competed for the challenge and some of these ideas will grow to dominate the sector in their niches in a few years.\nThere are also several examples from outside our shores. In Zambia, the government partnered with IBM to deploy a mobile program aimed at better managing the inventory and delivery of 200 life-saving prescription drugs. Staff members from three local health facilities are now using mobile devices with barcode scanners to record stock and generate real-time views of supplies. The solution also allows workers to transfer supplies and identify trends, thereby preventing gaps in the medical supply chain and ensuring that citizens have access to the medications they need.\nWhether it is in the public or private sectors, demands for data and information for multiple purposes, including performance improvement, accountability, and stakeholder decision making, are likely to increase in the future.  At the same time, there is a growing tech community with technology startups, developers and a fast-moving technology ecosystem which has been dubbed Silicon Lagoon.\nThe reason we are not measuring enough in the public sector is not because we lack the tools or the technology. It is also not for a lack of need or demand, but mostly it is because it\u2019s convenient for many not to measure, so that we do not know. Ignorance, for them, is bliss\u2026\nIf we want to transform our health sector, we must begin to measure performance. We may be shocked by what we find.\n  P/s: If you know of  projects, initiatives, ideas using technology innovatively in our health sector please share with us on twitter @nighealthwatch"}, {"author": "Chikwe Ihekweazu", "headline": "Liberia is declared Ebola free: can Nigeria support its Neighbours more?", "body": "Thankfully, Liberia is on its way back. The Ebola outbreak has been declared over, and life is returning to \u201cnormal\u201d. The streets are full of activity, and schools have reopened. Across the country, there is an unmistakable sense that people are desperate to get on with their lives.\nArriving Monrovia in January 2015, it felt familiar; like a mid-sized Nigerian town \u2013 perhaps Abakiliki or Ilorin. The food was familiar \u2013 fish, plantain, rice \u2026 with lots of red pepper. The electricity situation was still very poor, and most people in Monrovia relied on generators. As we drove past a white compound, the driver explained that it belonged to Charles Taylor. I shuddered as I thought of all the lives lost in a senseless civil war. About half a kilometer down the road, we passed another big white building on the left of Tubman Boulevard. It had \u201cNigeria House\u201d boldly inscribed on it. It\u2019s the Nigerian High Commission. The driver went on to explain with a sense of gratitude and respect the role that Nigeria had played in Liberia\u2019s history. I could not remember any other country that I had been to where I consistently had received such a warm welcome as in Liberia. I was proud.\nThe UN still had a military mission in Liberia. In the UN compound, there was a mix of military and police uniformed guys all around. I immediately noticed the uniform of the Nigerian police in the mix. The good work done by Nigeria around the sub-continent is often not recognised enough by Nigerians at home. Monrovia, Liberia\u2019s capital is home to about a third of the 4 million Liberians.  As is almost always the case, I ran into a number of Nigerian colleagues working in the various organisations responding to the outbreak, and we soon formed a tight bond. I slowly found my way around Monrovia.\nFrom the outside, with all the horror stories of Ebola in the popular press, it is easy to imagine Liberia as a country on the brink, especially with its history of protracted conflicts and civil war. But there is nothing further from the truth. Yes, it had been ill prepared for an outbreak of this severity and magnitude, as many other countries would have been, but sometimes there is nothing as powerful as grief to unite people in seeking a better future. The most important line of defence for Liberia is to rebuild the confidence of its population in the capacity of its government to prioritize the health of its citizens. This will require a complete turnaround in its health system\u2019s capacity to respond to the \u201croutine\u201d health needs of a population. It\u2019s only by responding to these issues in \u201cpeacetime\u201d and building trust, that it will have the capacity to respond better to the next crisis. When a society loses confidence in those to whom they would normally turn to in times of need, they resort to actions that can generally be considered \u201cirrational\u201d and \u201cillogical\u201d and unwittingly spread the disease further.\nIn order to rebuild their health system, Liberia will need the support of other West African countries, especially Nigeria.  At the beginning of the outbreak, Liberia was widely reported to have about 50 doctors working in the country;  one of the lowest physician-to-population ratios in the world. In Nigeria, there are over 30 medical colleges producing about 3,000 doctors annually. Perhaps, it is time to form strong regional alliances between the various postgraduate colleges in a win-win situation  including training and service for all the countries in the region. The same concept could apply to nursing professionals, pharmacists and medical laboratory scientists. However, this will only work if we are able to go about this with humility and a sense of service, not one of pride and arrogance.  \nFor Nigeria, it is time to think of our engagement with the sub-continent beyond the military and the police. Not many people may know about the \u201cTechnical Aid Corps (TAC)\u201d scheme that was established by the military regime of General Ibrahim Babangida in 1987 (like many other important institutions in Nigeria, it has no website for the public to follow its work). The sole purpose of the scheme is assisting States in Africa, Caribbean and specific regions in their social-economic development effort. Nigerian experts in various fields of human endeavour participate. Its most recent deployments are reported to be Uganda and Rwanda. Rwanda? I can guess what you are thinking! Until we begin to hold these Nigerian institutions to account on how they represent the strategic interests of our country, we cannot expect much to change.\nOut of this crisis must emerge a new Liberia. While the stories of dictators, civil war and Ebola are true, they cannot be Liberia\u2019s \u201csingle story\u201d. With a beautiful beach front right at the heart of the city, there is no reason for Monrovia not to be the favorite destination of Nigeria\u2019s emerging middle class. As Liberia grows, it will also begin to engage with the various opportunities in Nigeria. The earlier we really begin to see West-Africa for the common market that it should be, the greater the opportunities will be for the continent.\nFor now, it\u2019s just great that Liberia can get on with the difficult task of nation building."}, {"author": "Chikwe Ihekweazu", "headline": "Something to be proud of: Nigeria\u2019s Role in the AU Response to the Ebola Outbreak", "body": "There is increasing optimism that we will get to the end of the Ebola epidemic that has so badly affected Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea over the past year. In the first week of April, the lowest number of cases (30) were reported since May 2014. While there may still be some challenges ahead, the scale of the response and the translation of several learning points from the early part of the response have led to the quiet optimism that the end is in sight. This optimism is shared by responding organisations as well as health care workers in the most affected countries. Most of the current conversations have begun to focus on the restoration of health services with a strict infection control and prevention component. One organisation that has played a major role in this response but not gotten as much credit as it deserves is the \u201cAfrican Union\u201d (AU).\nWhile I was in Liberia earlier this year supporting the Ebola respose, I worked with epidemiologists, doctors, nurses, pharmacists and public health officers that are part of the African Union Support to Ebola Outbreak in West Africa (ASEOWA). ASEOWA is the African Union\u2019s contribution to on-going efforts to stop the transmission of the Ebola Virus Disease (EVD) in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone. Under Operation ASEOWA, health professionals were mobilized from around the African continent and deployed to the affected countries to assist with outbreak control efforts. This is the first time ever that the AU is initiating and implementing a mission of this size in response to a health crisis on the continent. The mission has  contributed significantly both in supporting the public health as well as clinical response to the outbreak. It contributed epidemiologists, who became part of the outbreak response activities, and clinicians supporting the restoration of critical health services.\nThe ASEOWA team of close to a thousand colleagues was made up of large contingents from Nigeria, Kenya and Ethiopia. Being Africans themselves, most of the ASEOWA team quickly integrated into various aspects of the response and rapidly gained the confidence of local colleagues. Whenever necessary, they joined teams in the field, going to some of the \u201chardest-to-reach\u201d areas to support various outbreak control activities. As the cases began to decline, members of the team were increasingly deployed into healthcare facilities to support activities that would lead to the restoration of services to the population. They acted not just as rare clinical resource in this situation but also provided emotional support and inspiration to other colleagues who felt exhausted and anxious after months of working under such difficult circumstances.\nThis being the first deployment of human resources in a health mission ever by the AU, there were some teething problems. Some colleagues had to wait longer than necessary before they were deployed to specific roles, and there were some uncertainties about where exactly their skills could be optimally utilised within the large response. The deployment of close to a thousand colleagues also required significant human resources management and logistics. There will definitely be many lessons to learn.  A comprehensive and independent evaluation of Operation ASEOWA is needed to learn vital lessons, both from the deployed individuals and the receiving countries\nThe large Nigerian delegation was ably led by Dr Joshua Obasanya, deployed from the Nigerian Centre for Disease Control. He was until recently the Director of Nigeria\u2019s Tuberculosis Control Program so came with years of experience of managing not only one of the oldest diseases known to man but one that had similar difficult elements that are key to the control such as \u201ccontact tracing\u201d. He was also part of the team that contained the outbreak of Ebola in Nigeria.\n\n\nDr Obasanya, leader of the Nigerian Delegation and Deputy Head of the ASEOWA team in Liberia\nThere have been recent pronouncements about the potential establishment of an \u201cAfrican Centre for Disease Control\u201d, maybe following the European model \u201cEuropean Centre for Disease Control\u201d. While this is a great idea on face value, it may be a bit premature. Right now, priority should be given to strengthen each country\u2019s capacity to carry out their statutory responsibility of responding to infectious disease threats in their own countries. In addition, the international health regulations actually provide an excellent framework for action from the international community when this is needed. While there is general agreement that this may not have worked optimally in this response, emphasis should be laid on strengthening capacity in individual countries rather than creating new organisations with uncertain mandates. The primary responsibility of preventing, managing and controlling infectious disease threats should remain firmly with each country.\nHowever, in exceptional circumstances like this, the AU should indeed be well placed to mobilize resources from countries like Nigeria, and it has done this fairly successfully during this response. Hopefully, there will be many lessons to be learnt, so that, while we are grateful for all the help from outside, the skills and experience gained by African colleagues on this mission will serve the continent well.\nWe look forward to welcoming those of our ASEOWA colleagues, who are still in the field, back home."}, {"author": "Chikwe Ihekweazu", "headline": "ON WORLD TB DAY, THERE IS LITTLE TO CELEBRATE IN NIGERIA", "body": "First published on Nigeria Health Watch.\nAs the Ebola epidemic in West Africa slows and falls away from the headlines, there is a temptation to view this outbreak as an isolated event and go back to life as usual. In Nigeria, the fairly successful response to the Ebola epidemic has brought a bit of credibility to the Nigerian health sector, with many Nigerian public health professionals smiling when confronted with the question \u201cHow did you guys do it?\u201d While there is definitely some satisfaction to be gained in the response to the Ebola outbreak in Nigeria, it does not change the fact that we are still in a precarious situation with several other infectious disease threats, which kill thousands of people in Nigeria. No other disease illustrates better our collective inability to deliver the essentials of a modern public health response to those who need help the most, in the most timely and efficient manner, than our response to tuberculosis (TB).\nWhile diseases like Ebola kill swiftly and produce horrific and acute symptoms, TB consumes many of its unknowing victims over a long period. It often goes undiagnosed for months, if not years, while it multiplies in families and communities. People infected with TB are often poor, marginalised and voiceless. Individuals who are ill with TB and not treated, can spread the bacteria through the air. Without correct treatment, more than 80 percent of people who fall ill will eventually waste away \u2014 coughing up blood while their bodies are ravaged by the disease \u2014 until they die. The difference is that they do not die in days, but in months \u2026 sometimes years.\nFor many years, there has been widespread suspicion that most of the cases of TB occurring in Nigeria are not detected by the system and are never able to access care. Under-diagnosis is probably the most significant reason for the low numbers of cases reported in Nigeria. TB diagnosis and care is only available in the public sector and in a few faith-based healthcare facilities. However, these sites are very unappealing for patients, as they are often poorly maintained inaccessible and located at the corners of hospitals.\nThe derelict \u201cChest Unit\u201d of the University of Nigeria Teaching Hospital (UNTH) hidden away at its old site\nThe first ever population based TB prevalence survey, (an attempt at measuring the burden of TB ) was conducted in Nigeria in 2012. Data from this survey provides some context to the low case notification data. The survey revealed a doubling of the estimated overall prevalence (the total number of people with TB) and a tripling of the estimated incidence (the total number of new cases) from previous WHO estimates. Based on the survey\u2019s findings, Nigeria\u2019s population of 170 million , in 2012, the estimated number of new cases of all forms of TB should have been about 550,000. However, Nigeria notified a total of only 97,000 new cases of all forms of TB in 2012, revealing a huge gap in case detection. Using these updated figures, Nigeria\u2019s case detection rate for all forms of TB currently stands at approximately 17 percent, one of the lowest case detection rates in the world. Based on the 2012 prevalence survey data, the country and WHO have updated their estimates for TB prevalence and incidence in Nigeria. This data is publicly available here.\nIn recent decades, we\u2019ve seen a surge in the number of people falling ill with strains of TB that are highly resistant to conventional treatment , which left untreated, kill rapidly. These strains are called multi drug resistant tuberculosis (MDR TB). Overall, the mean annual percentage increase in MDR-TB exceeded 100% in Nigeria, while MDR-TB case detection in 2012 was <10%. This means that most of the estimated 3,000 case of MDR TB in Nigeria are not diagnosed and do not enter the care pathway.\nAll over the world, tuberculosis is a difficult disease \u2013 difficult to diagnose and difficult to treat. But for the first time in years there is some real excitement on the TB scene with more rapid accurate diagnostic tools becoming available. Xpert MTB/RIF is a new test that simultaneously detects both the bacteria that causes TB and resistance to rifampicin, one of the main drugs used for its treatment directly from sputum in under two hours. WHO has recommended the use of the technology since December 2010 and is monitoring its global roll-out to promote coordination. A list of all the sites that have procured this new diagnostic option can be found here.\nMore than ever before, the Ebola outbreak presents the responsible public health departments and agencies in Nigeria with an opportunity to engage the attention of the Nigerian people to call for collective action to prevent future outbreaks and build capacity to respond to ongoing ones. We have a moral obligation to lend our voices to this broader struggle. We have learnt from the HIV/AIDS global epidemic that robust health systems are critical in mounting and sustaining a vigorous response to an emerging disease threat. This 2014 Ebola outbreak provides a unique opportunity to rebuild and strengthen health systems and should lead to much more robust investment in public health.\nTo find out how Nigeria has spent the US$ 147,354,856 that it received from the Global Fund in grants since the inception of the fund, go to their website here.

I knew that Bolton would not have heard of me, would not prepare, and would not particularly care about the sensibilities of the audience, which was made up of several hundred prominent executives, mostly Italian CEOs. When we met, he did not look at me, he just looked over my shoulder to see if someone more important or famous might be around. I\u2019m sure ambassador Bolton probably thought sharing the stage with some young guy was beneath him.\nI volunteered that the ambassador should go first, given his standing. He accepted and delivered a monologue that had little to do with the topic. Just the well-known one-liners and doctrine of ambassador John Bolton. His greatest hits, so to speak. None of it responded to the specific interests of the businessmen in the audience.\nI had prepared thoroughly, and after ambassador Bolton made his points, I responded with my opening remarks in Italian and included a joke that got everyone laughing, which Bolton of course could not understand since he did not speak Italian. I pulled two or three other little things like that, which were a product of preparation and caring about who was in the audience.\nBottom line, the young unknown diplomat destroyed the celebrity. Afterwards, Shimon Peres (who was sitting in the front row) came up to me and whispered in his distinct, gravelly voice, \"young man, you have demonstrated how to engage in asymmetrical warfare.\" We spoke later that night, and he told me that whenever a lesser experienced or lesser known person goes into competition with someone more experienced and better known, to make that person\u2019s standing a weaknesses.

We were both back in Italy at the same place on Lake Como. We had our last conversation, discussing Russia, while drinking wine on a gorgeous Italian night.

Donald Trump proposes \u201cshutting down\u201d parts of the Internet as a security strategy\u200a\u2014\u200ademonstrating both poor judgment and ignorance about how technology works. His penchant to censor extends to revoking press credentials and threatening to punish media platforms that criticize him.\nFinally, we believe that government plays an important role in the technology economy by investing in infrastructure, education and scientific research. Donald Trump articulates few policies beyond erratic and contradictory pronouncements. His reckless disregard for our legal and political institutions threatens to upend what attracts companies to start and scale in America. He risks distorting markets, reducing exports, and slowing job creation.\nWe stand against Donald Trump\u2019s divisive candidacy and want a candidate who embraces the ideals that built America\u2019s technology industry: freedom of expression, openness to newcomers, equality of opportunity , public investments in research and infrastructure, and respect for the rule of law.We embrace an optimistic vision for a more inclusive country, where American innovation continues to fuel opportunity, prosperity and leadership.\n*DISCLAIMER: The individuals listed below have endorsed in their personal capacity and this does not reflect the endorsement of any organization, corporation or entity to which they are affiliated.

The coming decade will see societies transform as humans learn to live alongside robots.\nJapan is home to the longest-living citizens on earth and the biggest elderly population of any country\u2014and it\u2019s not getting any younger. Japan\u2019s current life expectancy is 80 years for men and 87 years for women and is expected to rise to 84 and 91, respectively, over the next 45 years. Between 2010 and 2025, the number of Japanese citizens 65 years or older is expected to increase by 7 million. Today, 25 percent of Japan\u2019s population is age 65 or older. By 2020, this is projected to increase to 29 percent and reach 39 percent by 2050.\nAll of those long-living elderly will need caretakers. Yet Japan\u2019s low birthrates mean that what once was a staple of Japanese family life\u2014taking care of one\u2019s grandparents and great-grandparents\u2014will no longer be a viable model at the scale the nation needs. There will not be enough grandchildren.\nWith Japan\u2019s persistently strict immigration policies curtailing the number of workers in the country, there will not be enough humans around to do the job at all. Japan\u2019s Ministry of Health, Labor, and Welfare predicts a need for 4 million eldercare nurses by 2025. Right now there are only 1.49 million in the country. Japan allows only 50,000 work visas annually, and unless something drastic changes, the math does not work.\nThis labor shortage will hit service-industry jobs like eldercare with ferocity and will be exacerbated because caretakers have a high job turnover rate due to low pay and high rates of work-related injury from lifting patients.\nEnter the robots.\nOur future caretakers are being developed in a Japanese factory right now. Just as Japanese companies reinvented cars in the 1970s and consumer electronics in the 1980s, they are now reinventing the family. The robots depicted in the movies and cartoons of the 1960s and 1970s will become the reality of the 2020s.\nRival Japanese companies Toyota and Honda are leveraging their expertise in mechanical engineering to invent the next generation of robots. Toyota built a nursing aide named Robina\u2014modeled after Rosie, the cartoon robot nanny and housekeeper in The Jetsons\u2014as part of their Partner Robot Family, a line of robots to take care of the world\u2019s growing geriatric population. Robina is a \u201cfemale\u201d robot, 60 kilograms in weight and 1.2 meters tall, that can communicate using words and gestures. She has wide-set eyes, a moptop hairdo, and even a flowing white metallic skirt.\nRobina\u2019s brother, Humanoid, serves as a multipurpose home assistant. He can do the dishes, take care of your parents when they\u2019re sick, and even provide impromptu entertainment: one model plays the trumpet, another the violin. Both versions are doppelgangers for the famous Star Wars C-3PO robot, although in gleaming white instead of gold.\nIn response, Honda has created ASIMO (the Advanced Step in Innovative Mobility robot), a fully functional humanoid that looks like a four-foot-tall astronaut stuck on Earth. ASIMO is sophisticated enough to interpret human emotions, movements, and conversation. Equipped with cameras that function as eyes, ASIMO can follow voice commands, shake hands, and answer questions with a nod or by voice. He even bows to greet others, demonstrating good Japanese manners. For an elderly patient, ASIMO can fulfill a range of tasks, from helping the patient get out of bed to holding a conversation.\nHonda is also focusing much of its research and commercialization on robotic limbs and assistance devices that are robotic but not free-standing robots. Its Walking Assist device wraps around the legs and back of people with weakened leg muscles, giving them extra power to move on their own. In the future, expect to see Honda making robotic hands and arms. Its goal is nothing less than helping paraplegics walk and the very frail rediscover the speed and power of their youth.\nNumerous other Japanese companies are pushing the big players like Toyota and Honda. Tokai Rubber Industries, in conjunction with the Japanese research institute RIKEN, has unveiled the Robot for Interactive Body Assistance (RIBA), which can pick up and set down humans up to 175 pounds and is designed for patient comfort: it resembles a giant smiling bear and is covered in a soft skin to guard against injury or pain.\nSimilarly, Japanese industrial automation company AIST has created PARO, a robot baby harp seal covered in soft white fur. PARO exhibits many of the same behaviors as a real pet. Designed for those who are too frail to care for a living animal or who live in environments that don\u2019t allow pets, such as nursing homes, it enjoys being held, gets angry when hit, and likes to nap.When President Barack Obama met PARO a few years ago on a tour of Japanese robotics innovations, he instinctually reached out and rubbed its head and back. It looks like a cute stuffed animal, but costs $6,000 and is classified by the US government as a class 2 medical device.\nJapan already leads the world in robotics, operating 310,000 of the 1.4 million industrial robots in existence across the world. It\u2019s turning to eldercare robots in part because it has to and in part because it, uniquely, is in a great position to leverage its advanced industrial technology toward the long assembly line of the human life span. But can robots really take care of humans?\n\u201cFor the idea of artificial companionship to be our new normal, we have to change ourselves, and in the process we are remaking human values and human connection.\u201d \u2014 Sherry Turkle, MIT professor\nJapan\u2019s private and public sectors certainly think so. In 2013, the Japanese government granted $24.6 million to companies focusing on eldercare robotics. Japan\u2019s prominent Ministry of Economy, Trade, and Industry chose 24 companies in May 2013 to receive subsidies covering one-half to two-thirds of the R&D costs for nursing care robots. Tasks for these robots include helping the elderly move between rooms; keeping tabs on those likely to wander; and providing entertainment through games, singing, and dancing.\nNevertheless, difficult challenges remain. On the technical side, it remains difficult to design robots capable of intimate activities like bathing patients or brushing their teeth. And most Japanese companies that are developing these robots specialize in industrial motors and electronic automation. They didn\u2019t enter the caretaking field with a keen grasp of how to forge an emotional connection, a crucial aspect of eldercare. Even as they improve, some observers\u2014 like Sherry Turkle, a professor of the social studies of science and technology at MIT\u2014question whether patients will ever be able to form a true emotional connection with robot caretakers. As Turkle warns, \u201cFor the idea of artificial companionship to be our new normal, we have to change ourselves, and in the process we are remaking human values and human connection.\u201d\nIf robot nurses catch on, she explains, they may even create a chasm between younger and older generations. \u201cIt\u2019s not just that older people are supposed to be talking,\u201d Turkle argues, referring to the goal of creating robots that can hold conversation, \u201cyounger people are supposed to be listening. We are showing very little interest in what our elders have to say. We are building the machines that will literally let their stories fall on deaf ears.\u201d\nThese technical questions (Can a robot brush a person\u2019s teeth?) and almost-spiritual doubts (Can, and should, emotional connections be made between humans and robots?) are both valid. Yet robot technology and applicability continue to advance in Japan, and answers to these questions will likely arise there in the near future. With too few caretakers, I expect robots to become a regular part of the Japanese family system.\nIf the aging nation can pull it off, robot caretakers will be a boon for its economy and will soon make the jump to the global economy, with potentially far-reaching consequences.\nMuch of the rest of the industrialized world is on the verge of a period of advanced aging that will mirror Japan\u2019s own. In Europe, all 28 member states of the European Union have populations that are growing older, and in the decades ahead, the percentage of Europe\u2019s population aged 65 and older will grow from 17 percent to 30 percent. China is already entering a period of advanced aging even as it continues to develop. Although its one-child policy is already being phased out, China is now demographically lopsided. Chinese women have on average 1.4 children, well below the replacement rate of 2.1, resulting in too few young people to provide for the elderly. The notable exception is the United States, where immigration policies partially mitigate the effects of an aging population.\nAs the populations of developed nations continue to age, they create a big market for those Japanese robots. And caretaking robots, alongside robotic limb technology, may simply be the first in a new wave of complex robots entering our everyday lives. Robots will be the rare technology that reaches the mainstream through elderly users first, spreading down as grandma shows off her next cutting-edge gadget for the kids and grandkids.\nTHE GEO-ROBOTIC LANDSCAPE\nThe robot landscape will be vastly differentiated by country. Just as wealthier and poorer citizens reside at different technological levels, so do wealthier and poorer countries.\nA few countries have already established themselves as leading robot societies. About 70 percent of total robot sales take place in Japan, China, the United States, South Korea, and Germany\u2014known as the \u201cbig five\u201d in robotics. Japan, the United States, and Germany dominate the landscape in high-value industrial and medical robots, and South Korea and China are major producers of less expensive consumer-oriented robots. While Japan records the highest number of robot sales, China represents the most rapidly growing market, with sales increasing by 25 percent every year since 2005.\nThere is quite a gap between the big five and the rest of the world. As both consumers and producers of robots, these countries outpace all others. By way of illustration, the number of industrial robots produced in South Korea, a country of 50 million people, is several times greater than the number produced in South America, Central America, Africa, and India combined, with populations totaling 2.8 billion. Russia is effectively a nonplayer in robotics despite its industrial base. It neither produces nor buys robots to any significant degree, instead maintaining extractive industries (natural gas, oil, iron, nickel) and industrial manufacturing plants that look and function the way they did in the 1970s and 1980s.\nRobots will be the rare technology that reaches the mainstream through elderly users first, spreading down as grandma shows off her next cutting-edge gadget for the kids and grandkids.\nThe big five\u2019s comparative advantage might even accelerate in the future, for these are the same countries that are most likely to incorporate the next generation of robotics into society, work, and home. They will own the name brands in consumer robots, and they\u2019ll power the software and networks that enable the robotics ecosystem. When I think about this symbiosis, I think about the Internet in the 1990s. It was not just the consumer-facing Internet companies that were born and based in Silicon Valley; it was also the network equipment makers like Cisco Systems and Juniper Networks. Today Cisco and Juniper have a combined 85,000 employees and $154 billion in market value. The same types of back-end systems will exist in the robotics industry. And the big five countries will benefit from being home to the high-paying jobs and wealth accumulation that go with being out ahead of the 191 other countries around the world. They will produce the Ciscos and Junipers of robotics.\nInterestingly, less developed countries might be able to leapfrog technologies as they enter the robot landscape. Countries in Africa and Central Asia have been able to go straight to cell phones without building landline telephones, and in the same way they might be able to jump ahead in robotics without having to establish an advanced industrial base.\nThe African Robotics Network (AFRON) offers a good model. A community of individuals and institutions, AFRON hosts events and projects to boost robotics-related education, research, and industry on the continent. Through initiatives like its 10 Dollar Robot Challenge, AFRON encourages the development of extremely low-cost robotics education. One winner was RoboArm, a project from Obafemi Awolowo University in Nigeria whose armlike structure is made out of plastic and runs on scavenged motors. The ability to generate low-cost innovation based on scarcity of materials is rooted in the concept of frugal innovation.\nAs robotics starts to spread, the degree to which countries can succeed in the robot era will depend in part on culture\u2014on how readily people accept robots into their lives. Western and Eastern cultures are highly differentiated in how they view robots. Not only does Japan have an economic need and the technological know-how for robots, but it also has a cultural predisposition. The ancient Shinto religion, practiced by 80 percent of Japanese, includes a belief in animism, which holds that both objects and human beings have spirits. As a result, Japanese culture tends to be more accepting of robot companions as actual companions than is Western culture, which views robots as soulless machines. In a culture where the inanimate can be considered to be just as alive as the animate, robots can be seen as members of society rather than as mere tools or as threats.\nIn contrast, fears of robotics are deeply seated in Western culture. The threat of humanity creating things we cannot control pervades Western literature, leaving a long history of cautionary tales. Prometheus was condemned to an eternity of punishment for giving fire to humans. When Icarus flew too high, the sun melted his ingenious waxed wings and he fell to his death. In Mary Shelley\u2019s Frankenstein, Dr. Frankenstein\u2019s grotesque creation wreaks havoc and ultimately leads to its creator\u2019s death\u2014and numerous B-movie remakes.\nThis fear does not pervade Eastern culture to the same extent. The cultural dynamic in Japan is representative of the culture through much of East Asia, enabling the Asian robotics industry to speed ahead, unencumbered by cultural baggage. Investment in robots reflects a cultural comfort with robots, and, in China, departments of automation are well represented and well respected in the academy. There are more than 100 automation departments in Chinese universities, compared with approximately 76 in the United States despite the larger total number of universities in the United States.\nIn South Korea, teaching robots are seen in a positive light; in Europe, they are viewed negatively. As with eldercare, in Europe robots are seen as machines, whereas in Asia they are viewed as potential companions. In the United States, the question is largely avoided because of an immigration system that facilitates the entry of new, low-cost labor that often ends up in fields that might otherwise turn to service robots. In the other parts of the world, attitudes often split the difference. A recent study in the Middle East showed that people would be open to a humanoid household-cleaning robot but not to robots that perform more intimate and influential roles such as teaching. The combination of cultural, demographic, and technological factors means that we will get our first glimpse of a world full of robots in East Asia.\nHUMANIZING ROBOTS\nThe first wave of labor substitution from automation and robotics came from jobs that were often dangerous, dirty, and dreary and involved little personal interaction, but increasingly, robots are encroaching on jobs in the service sector that require personalized skills. Jobs in the service sector that were largely immune from job loss during the last stage of globalization are now at risk because advances in robotics have accelerated in recent years, due to breakthroughs in the field itself as well as new advancements in information management, computing, and high-end engineering. Tasks once thought the exclusive domain of humans\u2014the types of jobs that require situational awareness, spatial reasoning and dexterity, contextual understanding, and human judgment\u2014are opening up to robots.\nTwo key developments have dovetailed to make this possible: improvements in modeling belief space and the uplink of robots to the cloud. Belief space refers to a mathematical framework that allows us to model a given environment statistically and develop probabilistic outcomes. It is basically the application of algorithms to make sense of new or messy contexts. For robots, modeling belief space opens the way for greater situational awareness. It has led to breakthroughs in areas like grasping, once a difficult robot task. Until recently belief space was far too complex to sufficiently compute, a task made all the more difficult by the limited sets of robot experience available to analyze. But advances in data analytics have combined with exponentially greater sets of experiential robot data to enable programmers to develop robots that can now intelligently interact with their environment.\nThe recent exponential growth of robot data is due largely to the development of cloud robotics, a term coined by Google researcher James Kuffner in 2010. Linked to the cloud, robots can access vast troves of data and shared experience to enhance the understanding of their own belief space. Before being hooked up to the cloud, robots had access to very limited data\u2014either their own experience or that of a narrow cluster of robots. They were stand-alone pieces of electronics with capabilities that were limited to the hardware and software inside the unit. But by becoming networked devices, constantly connected to the cloud, robots can now incorporate the experiences of every other robot of their kind, \u201clearning\u201d at an accelerating rate.\nImagine the kind of quantum leap that human culture would undertake if we were all suddenly given a direct link to the knowledge and experience of everyone else on the planet\u2014if, when we made a decision, we were drawing from not just our own limited experience and expertise but from that of billions of other people. Big data has enabled this quantum leap for the cognitive development of robots.\nWith a connection to the cloud, robots can now incorporate the experiences of every other robot of their kind, \u201clearning\u201d at an accelerating rate.\nAnother major development in robotics arrives through materials science, which has allowed robots to be constructed of new materials. Robots no longer have to be cased in the aluminum bodies of armor that characterized C-3PO or R2-D2. Today\u2019s robots can have bodies made of silicone, or even spider silk, that are eerily natural looking. Highly flexible components\u2014such as air muscles (which distribute power through tubes holding highly concentrated pressurized air), electroactive polymers (which change a robot\u2019s size and shape when stimulated by an electric field), and ferrofluids (basically magnetic fluids that facilitate more humanlike movement)\u2014have created robots that you might not even recognize as being artificial, almost like the Arnold Schwarzenegger cyborg in The Terminator. An imitation caterpillar robot designed by researchers at Tufts University to perform tasks as varied as finding land mines and diagnosing diseases is even biodegradable\u2014just like us.\nRobots are now also being built both bigger and smaller than ever before. Nanorobots, still in the early phases of development, promise a future in which autonomous machines at the scale of 10-9 meters (far, far smaller than a grain of sand) can diagnose and treat human diseases at the cellular level. On the other end of the spectrum, the world\u2019s largest walking robot is a German-made fire-breathing dragon that stands at 51 feet long, weighs 11 tons, and is filled with more than 20 gallons of stage blood. Apparently the Germans have a festival involving it.\nRecent advances will continue. It is not just Japan\u2019s government that is devoting ever-increasing resources to robotics. In the United States, President Obama launched the National Robotics Initiative in 2011 to stimulate development of robots for industrial automation, elder assistance, and military applications. Run by the National Science Foundation, the program has awarded more than $100 million in contracts. France has initiated a similar program, pledging $126.9 million to develop its industry and catch up to Germany. Sweden has similarly earmarked millions to give out to individuals and corporations through innovation awards such as Robotdalen (\u201crobot valley\u201d), launched in 2011.\nThe field of robotics is very much like where the world stood with the Internet 20 years ago. We are at the beginning of something: chapter one, page one.\nThe private sector is also investing at increasingly higher levels. Google purchased Boston Dynamics, a leading robotics design company with Pentagon contracts, for an untold sum in December 2013. It also bought DeepMind, a London-based artificial intelligence company founded by wunderkind Demis Hassabis. As a kid, Hassabis was the second-highest-ranked chess player in the world under the age of 14, and while he was getting his PhD in cognitive neuroscience, he was acknowledged by Science magazine for making one of the ten most important science breakthroughs of the year after developing a new biological theory for how imagination and memory work in the brain.\nAt DeepMind, Demis and his colleagues effectively created the computer equivalent of hand-eye coordination, something that had never been accomplished before in robotics. In a demo, Demis showed me how he had taught his computers how to play old Atari 2600 video games in the same way that humans play them, based on looking at a screen and adjusting actions through neural processes responding to an opponent\u2019s actions. He\u2019d taught computers how to think in much the way that humans do. Then Google bought DeepMind for half a billion dollars and is applying its expertise in machine learning and systems neuroscience to power the algorithms it is developing as it expands beyond Internet search and further into robotics.\nMost corporate research and development in robotics comes from within big companies (like Google, Toyota, and Honda), but venture capital funding in robotics is growing at a steep rate. It more than doubled in just three years, from $160 million in 2011 to $341 million in 2014. In its first year of investment, Grishin Robotics, a $25 million seed investment fund, evaluated more than 600 start-ups before coming to terms with the eight now in its portfolio. Singulariteam, a new Israeli venture capital fund, quickly raised two funds of $100 million each to invest in early-stage robotics and artificial intelligence. The appeal for investors is obvious: the market for consumer robots could hit $390 billion by 2017, and industrial robots should hit $40 billion in 2020.\nAs the technology continues to improve, there is an ongoing debate about just how radically human life will be transformed by advanced robots and whether robots will ultimately surpass us. One view in the debate is that it\u2019s inevitable robots will pass us; another is that they can\u2019t possibly compete with us; a third is that man and machine could merge. Within the robotics community, the future of technology is wrapped up in the concept of singularity, the theoretical point in time when artificial intelligence will match or surpass human intelligence. If singularity is achieved, it is unclear what the relationship between robots and humans will become. (In the Terminator series, once singularity is achieved, a self-aware computer system decides to launch a war on humans.)\nEnthusiasts for the singularity imagine that investments in robotics will do more than strengthen corporate balance sheets; they will radically enhance human well-being, eliminating mundane tasks and replacing diseased or aging parts of our bodies. The technology community is deeply divided about whether singularity is a good thing or a bad thing, with one camp believing it will enhance human experience as another camp, equally large, believes it will unleash a dystopian future where people become subservient to machines.\nBut will singularity occur?\nThose who believe that singularity will be achieved point to several key factors. First, they argue that Moore\u2019s law, which holds that the amount of computing power we can fit into a chip will double every two years, shows little sign of slowing down. Moore\u2019s law applies to the transistors and technology that control robots as well as those in computers. Add rapid advances in machine learning, data analytics, and cloud robotics, and it\u2019s clear that computing is going to keep rapidly improving. Those who argue for the singularity differ on when it will occur. Mathematician Vernor Vinge predicts that it will occur by 2023; futurist Ray Kurzweil says 2045. But the question looming over singularity is whether there\u2019s a limit on how far our technology can ultimately go.\nThose who argue against the possibility of singularity point to several factors. The software advances necessary to reach singularity demand a detailed scientific understanding of the human brain, but our lack of understanding about the basic neural structure of the brain impedes software development. Moreover, while weak artificial intelligence, whereby robots simply specialize in a specific function, is currently advancing exponentially, strong artificial intelligence, whereby robots demonstrate humanlike cognition and intelligence, is advancing only linearly. While inventions like IBM\u2019s Watson (the computer designed by IBM that beat Jeopardy! champions Ken Jennings and Brad Rutter) are exciting, scientists need a better understanding of the brain before these advances progress beyond winning a game show. Watson didn\u2019t actually \u201cthink\u201d; it was basically a very comprehensive search engine querying a large database. As robotics expert and UC Berkeley professor Ken Goldberg explains, \u201cRobots are going to become increasingly human. But the gap between humans and robots will remain\u2014it\u2019s so large that it will be with us for the foreseeable future.\u201d\nIt\u2019s my view that the current moment in the field of robotics is very much like where the world stood with the Internet 20 years ago. We are at the beginning of something: chapter one, page one. Just as it would have been difficult in the days of dial-up modems to imagine an Internet video service like YouTube streaming over 6 billion hours of video every month, it is difficult for us to imagine today that lifelike robots may walk the streets with us, work in the cubicle next to ours, or take our elderly parents for a walk and then help them with dinner.\nThis is not happening today and it will not happen tomorrow, but it will happen during most of our lifetimes. The level of investment in robotics, combined with advances in big data, network technologies, materials science, and artificial intelligence, are setting the foundation for the 2020s to produce breakthroughs in robotics that bring today\u2019s science fiction right into mainstream use.\nAlec Ross is the New York Times bestselling author of The Industries of the Future, recently released by Simon & Schuster.

They want Apple to hack its own product by building an entirely new version of its iOS software and they want it to deliberately have security holes and weakened encryption so that the FBI can access the data on iPhones. \nIf Apple does this, then the idea that only the FBI will be able to exploit this new vulnerability is na\u00efve. By mandating that companies undermine their own encryption, it opens vulnerabilities that weaken the integrity of security systems for everyone.\nIf a backdoor is built for the FBI, then I believe that the door is also open for the Chinese, the Russians, and for non-state based hackers to enter, too.\nWhat\u2019s more, if US policy requires mandatory assistance from companies to break encryption, it is certain that other countries will demand the same on the same precedent.  And unlike the United States, their motives will not necessarily be bound by the rule of law.  This puts American companies in an impossible position. \nThe FBI is not acting with malignant intent. This is no longer J. Edgar Hoover\u2019s FBI. However, by trying to solve a short-term problem (accessing the contents of a single terrorist\u2019s iPhone) they are creating a much bigger, long-term problem: opening access to once secure systems.\nAs more of our life is connected to the cloud, the idea that mandatory backdoors are built-in is a nightmare. In my book The Industries of the Future, I argue that as we store things like our medical records to the cloud, that we must make sure those systems are encrypted and secure. This means no mandatory backdoors. \nFor these reasons and others, intelligence agencies including the NSA and GCHQ have come out clearly in favor of strong encryption with no backdoors. Law enforcement has other methods to get access to data other than mandating decryption. \nFor all of our security, let\u2019s hope that Apple prevails on this issue and the FBI does not.\nAlec Ross is the author of The Industries of the Future, recently released by Simon & Schuster."}, {"author": "Alec Ross", "headline": "Silicon Valley dominated the world for 20 years. Who wins in the next 20 years, though, is still a very big question.", "body": "\u201cWe want to create our own Silicon Valley.\u201d\nIf there\u2019s a single sentence I\u2019ve heard in every country I\u2019ve been to, it\u2019s this one. Silicon Valley has been home to technology-driven innovation for a long time, but the 20-year period from 1994 to 2014 was something special.\nPeople all over the world witnessed a spectacular level of innovation and wealth creation, all emerging from a small 30-mile long, 15-mile-wide strip of Northern California. Other states and countries have been attempting to build the \u201cnext Silicon Valley\u201d for years now. At this point, there\u2019s even a formula.\nAs Marc Andreessen writes:\nThe popular recipe for creating the \u201cnext\u201d Silicon Valley goes something like this:\nBuild a big, beautiful, fully equipped technology park;\nMix in R&D labs and university centers;\nProvide incentives to attract scientists, firms and users;\nInterconnect the industry through consortia and specialized suppliers;\nProtect intellectual property and tech transfer;\nEstablish a favorable business environment and regulations.\nIt happens all the time all over the world. And it never works.\nWhen I\u2019m asked, \u201cWhat can we do to create our own Silicon Valley?\u201d my response surprises many people: \u201cYou can\u2019t,\u201d I say. \u201cIt\u2019s too late. Silicon Valley has a decades-long head start creating the perfect environment for creating Internet businesses. What you can do, though, is position your communities to compete and succeed in those areas of innovation that are still to come.\u201d\nThe development of fields such as genomics, robotics, and cyber will all benefit from the interventions that Andreessen listed. But for cities or countries seeking to create the next hotbed for any of these fields, there are also broader factors to consider.\nBuilding an innovation-rich place like Silicon Valley requires specific cultural and labor-market characteristics that can contradict both a society\u2019s norms and the more controlling impulses of government leaders. \nA critical factor: domain expertise\nWith the industries of the future \u2014 a topic I researched extensively as part of my new book \u2014 new avenues of opportunity for countries and people alike will hinge on domain expertise: deep knowledge about a single industry, which tends to concentrate in specific cities or regions. Detroit has domain expertise in cars, Paris has it in fashion, and Silicon Valley has it in Internet-based businesses.\nDomain expertise for the industries of the future is still broadly distributed. To understand domain expertise, consider the following question: Why do a ridiculously high percentage of Internet companies still come out of Silicon Valley when massive investment is being made around the world to compete with it? Many factors are at play, but domain expertise is the most important.\nFor more than 20 years, the world\u2019s best computer scientists have overwhelmingly been based in Silicon Valley. They could have been born anywhere, but they came to Silicon Valley for school (Stanford or Berkeley), employment (which creates a self-reinforcing cycle that concentrates talent), and investment (with the Valley offering far and away the most access to early-stage capital in the world). And they came to be included in a culture and community that placed the computer science engineer at the highest level of social status.\nThe Valley came to be not just any old industrial center, but a kind of beacon\u2014a place that promised not just opportunity but a sense of belonging\u2014and that continues to attract wave after wave of ambitious entrepreneurs. But nothing like that exists yet for the industries of the future, where the most interesting and important innovations are taking place with greater geographic spread than we see with Internet-based innovation.\nThere are early geographic leaders in each of the fields, but it is still far too early to describe any of these as the winners or losers in the competition to be home to the next generation of innovation. And what concentration there is today is not destined to be permanent.\nIn the current landscape, the most important work in the commercialization of genomics is clustered around universities where much of the original research and development took place. It is in and around Boston because of Harvard and MIT, Baltimore because of Johns Hopkins, and Silicon Valley because of Stanford and the Universities of California in San Francisco and Berkeley. Walking through the offices of these companies, one can\u2019t help but notice how diverse the workforces are. European, Asian, African, and South American employees fill these companies and live in Boston, Baltimore, or California because they all studied at American universities.\nThe other major prong of genetics research is in China. Though it does not have a top university program in genetics, China has done an excellent job recruiting its citizens back home after they have studied abroad. As a result, Beijing is quickly becoming a center of domain expertise in genomics. In cyber, the most interesting companies are often based proximate to government, where domain expertise was developed inside the best law enforcement and intelligence communities, including Washington, D.C., Tel Aviv, London, and Moscow. Europe\u2019s first cybersecurity accelerator, CyLon, was cofounded by two top foreign policy aides to British prime ministers. One of the world\u2019s largest cybersecurity companies, Kaspersky Lab, is full of former Russian military and intelligence officers.\nIsrael has many of the best cybersecurity firms, founded by people who got their start in cyber in the Israeli Defense Forces, especially Unit 8200, Yehida Shmoneh-Matayim, the intelligence corps focused on signals intelligence.\nIn robotics, domain expertise and the early commercial leadership is generally concentrated where there is preexisting domain expertise in electronics and advanced manufacturing\u2014in countries like Japan, South Korea, and Germany. Yet even as the industries of the future offer new opportunities to rising hotbeds of innovation around the world, it\u2019s interesting to watch how Silicon Valley\u2019s influence lingers and continues to draw start-ups in almost every industry. Consider the example of digital currency and fintech, industries of the future that blend old world and new.\nNew York and London are the world\u2019s two dominant centers of domain expertise in global banking today, and both are home to substantial fintech investment. Over the past five years, the United Kingdom and Ireland were home to 52 percent of all the fintech financing in Europe. And New York drew even larger levels of fintech financing than London, with dozens of deals putting hundreds of millions of dollars into the bank accounts of technology companies trying to make the banking sector smarter.\nBut when Zac Townsend wanted to start a company focused on smartening up the banking industry, he did not start it in London or New York. He started it in California. It mattered less to Zac that expertise in banking specifically was in New York or London than that the expertise in innovation and its supporting culture was in California. He believed that in order to change the banking system, he had to work with it but away from it\u2014an approach that is also reflected in the broader data.\nAlthough New York and London are the global centers for banking, they are respectively second and third in fintech financing behind Silicon Valley, which gets about one-third of all the investments that take place in the fintech space. This raises an interesting question about just how distributed the industries of the future are going to be.\nSilicon Valley: the next Roman empire?\nWhen twentysomethings like Zac decide to start a company and determine that in order to do so they need to be in California, it creates a self-perpetuating cycle. More broadly, Zac\u2019s decision to base his new data-driven finance company in Silicon Valley reflects a roiling debate over just how domain expertise will develop in the big data industry and what effect this is going to have on the global economy as a whole. With the major impact that big data is having on almost every industry, the way that big data expertise develops has the potential to change the very nature of business. And investors are placing big bets on two very different answers.\nWill big data serve to centralize businesses, pulling more industries into the gravitational field of Silicon Valley? Or will it allow more businesses to innovate wherever they are, in effect creating more opportunities in more places around the world than has been possible before now?\nOn one side of the argument is Charlie Songhurst, who sees the Valley as a burgeoning global empire. Because of Silicon Valley, Charlie says, \u201cGlobal regional inequality is going to be unlike anything we\u2019ve ever seen except maybe the comparative power of Rome versus the rest of the ancient world.\u201d While I think Charlie overstates things, he makes an argument that\u2019s worth examining.\nHis thesis lines up with a number of other thinkers who believe that Silicon Valley\u2019s expertise in software and analytics will swallow up entire industries and cause massive centralization. The founders of Uber had no particular expertise in transportation, but that did not matter because of their ability to build a software and analytics platform. The idea that underlies Songhurst\u2019s vision is that Silicon Valley companies could eventually run everything in which software and big data are useful\u2014which is basically every industry on the planet. So what\u2019s going to happen in this new data-driven empire, according to Charlie? \u201cIt\u2019s a very simple equation,\u201d he says. \u201cCountries with high education and low wages will export IQ. That will be the Baltics, India, China. Of course, it\u2019s terrible if you\u2019re in Ohio or England or France or someone competing with an Estonian. So what you\u2019ll get is a massive mean reversion of income throughout the world where the Valley, Israel, China, and maybe a couple of other places get very high economic returns and everywhere else in the world starts to revert to the mean. Again, it starts to look more like the Roman Empire.\u201d\nIt is also the case that while the powers that be in Silicon Valley might not be the earliest movers in fields like precision agriculture, once success is achieved elsewhere, they don\u2019t just sit back as passive bystanders and watch it grow. Google chairman Eric Schmidt recruited an Israeli entrepreneur, Dror Berman, to move to Silicon Valley and head up Innovation Endeavors, a large venture firm that invests Schmidt\u2019s money. Israel is home to many of the 20th century\u2019s great innovations in farming. Berman brought the intellectual curiosity about agriculture with him to Silicon Valley and developed Farm2050, a partnership that aspires to combine data science and robotics to improve farming with a group of partners as diverse as Google, DuPont, and 3D Robotics.\nDror recognized that Silicon Valley can be a little too navel-gazing, and told me that 90 percent of the region\u2019s entrepreneurs focus on 10 percent of the world\u2019s problems. With Farm2050, he is trying to bring Silicon Valley\u2019s A game to agriculture. Silicon Valley\u2019s history as a home to apricot and plum orchards is long past, and if it does establish itself as the source of winning investment or innovation for precision agriculture, it will contradict the idea that domain expertise will drive the industries of the future. Instead, it would suggest, as futurist Jaron Lanier has argued in his book Who Owns the Future?, that those who hold the most data, the fastest servers, and the most processing power will drive all growth from here on out.\nIt\u2019s basically the idea that Google could do my job and your job\u2014 and everyone else\u2019s job\u2014better if they wanted to simply by applying their top-of-the-line analytics abilities. There is an increasingly large audience, however, that holds a different view from Charlie Songhurst. They believe that big data, instead of absorbing and supplanting other industries, will serve as a broad tool that every existing industry can use to spur growth. The idea is that data will become widely usable and scalable enough that it won\u2019t have domain expertise in the same way that other high-barrier-to-entry industries of the future like genomics or robotics do.\nThis view was explained to me by Mark Gorenberg, a veteran of West Coast venture investing who saw the investment case for analytics early and built a venture capital firm around it, Zetta Venture Partners. Mark has been in venture capital for a quarter-century and splits most of his time among investing, work with MIT, and serving as an advisor to the president of the United States as a member of the President\u2019s Council of Advisors on Science and Technology. Gorenberg believes the big data economy will extend far beyond Silicon Valley.\nHe says: \u201cAnalytics businesses will come from anywhere. You have the algorithmic expertise on one side that is coming out of a lot of universities and you have the domain expertise for particular industries, which manifest themselves everywhere.\u201d Gorenberg argues that as the big data market grows over the next couple of decades, it can be a source of revitalization for old industrial centers where local domain expertise exists.\nIn the rust belt, for example, he sees strong opportunities for the development of analytics firms rooted in the region\u2019s strength managing industrial processes. He sees Boston\u2019s strength as a biotech center enabling it to create health data companies, and he foresees the creation of energy analytics companies in Texas. He predicts that we will see strong privacy and forensics companies forming around Washington, D.C., that build on the capabilities in the law enforcement and intelligence communities, providing high-paying jobs for people who worked at the NSA, CIA, and FBI.\nIf Gorenberg is correct that \u201cdomain expertise is everywhere,\u201d then there is no reason not to be optimistic about the prospects for big data firms developing outside the United States. It just takes a combination of algorithmic expertise and domain expertise.\nFor example, having lost out on the wealth creation built around the Internet, Germany is now determined to leverage its domain expertise in logistics and household appliances to own the analytics markets in those areas of traditional strength, an initiative it calls Industrie 4.0. If the big data market develops as Gorenberg predicts\u2014with the best companies being headquartered all over the world\u2014then wealth creation will look entirely different for big data than it did for the Internet, where the benefits were concentrated in a 30-by-15- mile area.\nI was persuaded by Gorenberg\u2019s view when I was in New Zealand and saw an example of how the combination of big data and domain expertise will determine the geography of the industries of the future. New Zealand is home to twice as many dairy cattle as human beings. The Kiwis know cows.\nWhile there, I learned about the impact of Pasture Meter, a precision-agriculture technology developed in Palmerston, a community of 82,000 people in the Manawatu-Wanganui region of New Zealand\u2019s North Island, more than 10,000 kilometers away from Silicon Valley. Pasture Meter uses advanced sensor technology to take 200 measurements per second over vast swaths of farmland to identify how much grass is in a paddock so that dairy cows can be distributed most effectively for feeding. It alerts farmers to the amount of feed they have and identifies low-production areas that need intervention from the farmer, say, more fertilizer.\nTraditional technology for evaluating fields, like ultrasound or rising plate meters, typically captures only 250 readings of a pasture, whereas Pasture Meter can take up to 18,500 readings. Anyone with a phone can use the technology, and it works regardless of factors like weather.\nIt may seem that monitoring pastures\u2014literally watching the grass grow\u2014is an unnecessary use of real-time analytics, but the Kiwi farmers know better. With the massive increase in upward economic mobility in China, there was increasing demand for beef and dairy products, but New Zealand\u2019s cattle farmers needed higher levels of efficiency\u2014greater scale and lower prices\u2014if they were going to sell into such a large market.\nChina\u2019s population is 288 times the size of New Zealand\u2019s. With strong domain expertise in dairy farming, local farmers and farm-equipment manufacturers knew that if they could feed their cattle more efficiently, that would increase output enough for them to export to China. What happened? Sales of beef from New Zealand to China soared 478 percent in one year. China surpassed New Zealand\u2019s neighbor Australia as New Zealand\u2019s largest export market, more than twice the size of what is exported from New Zealand to the United States.\nThe fact that it surprised me that it could be so important to know the location and concentration of grass in a field is exactly the point: New Zealand\u2019s farmers had the domain expertise, so they knew what needed to be built and they built it. It\u2019s too much to say that Pasture Meter deserves credit for the full 478 percent increase in beef exports, but local farmers bring it up as one of the important factors.\nWhat happened in New Zealand can and will happen in other industries where there may not be a deep history of big data and analytics, but where there is domain expertise in another industry that knows where and how analytics would add value. The big data applications themselves are easily scalable, can be done broadly around the world, and can be implemented whether or not there is much previous data experience\u2014as was the case for the people in Palmerston, New Zealand, who made equipment for the region\u2019s dairy farmers.\nSilicon Valley builds things that Silicon Valley wants, from nicer taxi services to more photo-sharing apps. But investors and entrepreneurs in Silicon Valley don\u2019t see the world through, say, the eyes of farmers. Thus, they are less likely than a company in the Manawatu Wanganui region of New Zealand\u2019s North Island to recognize the need for and develop a technology that enables greater beef and dairy production for export to China. While Marc Andreessen is as closely identified with Silicon Valley as anybody, he agrees that those fields that are early in their development can and should take root wherever there is deep knowledge about a specific area.\nHe has proposed that Detroit leverage its expertise in automotive mechanics to become \u201cDrone Valley,\u201d and suggests that rather than trying to create more Silicon Valleys, we should hope and plan for the creation of \u201c50 different variations of Silicon Valley, all unique from each other and all focusing on different domains.\u201d\nLarry Summers reinforced Andreessen\u2019s view, telling me, \u201cMy general line is, in essence, there is much more division of labor than there used to be. Strategies for countries, companies, and people are much more about building on your strength than offsetting your weaknesses than it used to be.\u201d\nThis effectively means to stop trying to chase after Silicon Valley and focus on the skills and processes that will unleash the next wave of innovation in fields in which there is already local expertise. My view is that the geographic spread of domain expertise in the industries of the future will ensure that the next stage of globalization produces centers of innovation and commercialization that are more geographically diverse than the last stage, when Silicon Valley enjoyed 20 years of domination.\nThere won\u2019t be a Roman Empire. The thought that software and big data\u2013savvy companies and entrepreneurs in Silicon Valley will reign supreme is not a crazy one, but I think that as big data becomes more widely adopted, it will be more of a commodity that any industry can use. There is a real opportunity for stakeholders with domain expertise to innovate for themselves, and in breathtaking ways.\nBut if they wait too long, some 28-year-olds in California are going to do it instead.\nIn the cases where an industry is too slow to adapt, then eventually more efficient, less expert start-ups (with big data expertise) like Uber will step in and take down companies with decades of domain expertise.\nIn the famous words of H. G. Wells, \u201cAdapt or perish.\u201d\nAlec Ross is the author of The Industries of the Future, to be released next week by Simon & Schuster.

Their answers?", "body": "During two years of intense research for the writing The Industries of the Future, my interviews with dozens of the world\u2019s most successful, powerful people often turned to parenting. We\u2019ve heard people like Carlos Slim, Eric Schmidt and Larry Summers talk about business or the economy, but talking to them about what skills and attributes today\u2019s children will need to compete and succeed in tomorrow\u2019s economy always got them far away from talking points. \nWhile I dedicate an entire chapter to the topic of parenting in The Industries of the Future, I did want to briefly share some common themes that emerged from my research.\n1. Make sure your kids are learning languages, foreign languages as well as a technical, programming, or scientific language. If big data, genomics, cyber, and robotics/AI are among the high-growth industries of the future, then the people who will make their livings in those industries need to be fluent in the coding languages behind them. Coding also teaches children a way to think and solve problems that is still valuable even if the computer programming language changes.\nSimilarly, as the economy grows more global, cultural fluency and the ability to communicate in more than just one language will grow even more important than they are today.\n2. Demand more academic enrichment out of your children\u2019s schools, but don\u2019t rely on them. My mother was nicknamed Becky the Barbarian in part because she was a relentless advocate for her children\u2019s education at school and at home. I did not appreciate it at the time, but that is what enabled a public school kid from West Virginia who had to work as a midnight janitor to achieve the success I have since had in business, government and academia.\nThe business leaders I spoke with suggested we all needed to follow the Becky the Barbarian model. Hold others to account but also hold yourself to account. Do something about it if your school isn\u2019t offering a rigorous education that meets your child\u2019s needs, but also do something about it if the hours after school for your children are spent unproductively. If your child\u2019s school does not teach them a foreign language, computer programming or challenging enough math, there are enough free resources online that you don\u2019t have an excuse as a parent to keep that from your children.\n3. Ingrain your children with a commitment to lifelong learning. The idea that education ends with an undergraduate or graduate university degree is an anachronism. That MBA or masters in electrical engineering that is so difficult to earn will be near-useless 15 years after graduation if there isn\u2019t a commitment to continuing to learn. The pace of change in business has quickened over the past 10 years and is only going to accelerate further. It\u2019s not the strongest who survive, or the most intelligent, but those most adaptable to change. Lifelong learners are the more resilient than anybody else in times of change.\nI\u2019ll conclude by stating the obvious: these three things are not meant to be comprehensive, nor do they account for social, emotional and spiritual development. But in discussions with many of the world\u2019s most successful people in business, these stand-out. Please share what you think are the key attributes today\u2019s children will need to be successful in tomorrow\u2019s economy!\nAlec Ross is the author of The Industries of the Future, to be released in February by Simon & Schuster."}, {"author": "Alec Ross", "headline": "China has a decision to make in 2016, and it's one that matters for the global economy", "body": "It\u2019s a rainy, smoggy day here in Shanghai\u2019s Pudong District.

On the positive side, the reforms it announced last year allowing for more truth in the value of its currency and interest rates were responsible steps forward. The crackdown against corruption continues, too.

If it opens up, it will position itself to better compete in the industries of the future. The devaluation of its currency and unwinding of its old systems will cause short-term economic distress, but it will be worth it. If it tightens up by slowing its reforms and continuing to crack down on free speech and journalism, its growth will slow down further, and there will be more rainy days in Shanghai.\nAlec Ross is the author of The Industries of the Future, to be released in February by Simon & Schuster."}, {"author": "Alec Ross", "headline": "I've traveled the globe, and I'm convinced that these are the cities we'll all want to watch in 2016", "body": "There are all sorts of lists of the best start-ups regions in the world ranking local ecosystems for innovation and entrepreneurship.

STOCKHOLM \nStockholm, Sweden is a lot more than Spotify. It is now the second largest producer of billion dollar start-ups after Silicon Valley on a per capita basis. The thing that stands out about young Swedish companies is the diversity. They\u2019re producing winners in fields as varied as telecommunications, gaming and the Internet of Things. The entrepreneurs and engineers from all over Sweden (with just 9.5 million people) converge on stylish Stockholm when it comes time to start a company.\nWhile I was in government, I noticed that Sweden\u2019s security-focused computer scientists are some of the best in the world.

Some of its analytics and biotech companies are among the most exciting in the world. \nThe best indication to me that the UK\u2019s Cambridge was ready to enter the first tier came from hearing the same thing on more than one phone call with world-leading investors. \nMe: Where are you calling from?\nBig Investor: Um, Cambridge University.\nMe: Nice! What are you doing up there?\nBig Investor: Well, uh, just talking to a couple companies.\n3. SEOUL \nSouth Korea is far-better known for its big electronics and automotive companies than it is for its start-ups, but that could soon change given the new maturity of a start-up scene in Seoul many years in the making.\nThe South Korean government is trying to tailor its regulatory environment to be as entrepreneur-friendly as possible. This includes $3.7 billion of spending by government in its start-ups.\nIts aggressive M&A environment allows for entrepreneurs and investors to achieve liquidity more easily than most other Asian markets and allows successful company founders to start that next company. \nMost important is a change in mindset. Following decades of military dictatorship, the safety of a traditional job in a big company was appealing to most Koreans. \u201cStability\u201d was valued above all else. South Koreans who have grown up in its vibrant democracy and always on youth-culture (to be young and Korean is to be LTE-connected) have an entrepreneurial mindset that is more like their peers across the ocean in California than that of their parents.\n4. MARYLAND \nOkay, I\u2019m cheating on this one. I live in Baltimore so my bias to what\u2019s happening in Maryland could stem from it not requiring time on an airplane. Here\u2019s the thing: Maryland is smack-dab in the middle of two fields that are going to see massive investment and commercialization in 2016: security and genomics. \nTo live in Maryland is to live shoulder-to-shoulder with some of the world\u2019s best mathematicians and computer scientists who work at the NSA, CIA or Beltway contractors that sell to government. More and more of these are abandoning the pension and anonymity lifestyle of career government service to start or join start-ups that are bringing individuals and enterprises intelligence-sector-grade cyber security. The NSA\u2019s cafeteria would be chock-a-block with VCs and headhunters, if only they were allowed on campus. \nMaryland is also home to what might be a better bet for 2017 than 2016: the commercialization of genomics. Billions of dollars of R&D $ flow into projects at the National Institutes of Health and Johns Hopkins University to turn our genetic data into \u201cPrecision Medicines\u201d that can tailor therapies to our genetic make-up. 15 years after the mapping of the human genome, we are almost to the point of mainstreaming Precision Medicines and when that happens, a lot of the innovation will come from scientist-rich Maryland.\nAlec Ross is the author of The Industries of the Future, to be released in February by Simon & Schuster."}, {"author": "Alec Ross", "headline": "Big banks once laughed at Bitcoin. Now, Goldman Sachs wants to use its technology.", "body": "Something happened last week that I think is going to change the course of history for Bitcoin and for financial technology more broadly. \nBitcoin has not supplanted traditional currencies the way that some of its early adopters imagined years ago. An early signal that Bitcoin would be hard-pressed to gain mainstream acceptance came in the form of mudballs that were thrown at it from Wall Street. JP Morgan CEO Jamie Dimon made a comment representative of the sentiment of many of his peers when he said, \u201cthe question isn\u2019t whether we accept it. The question is, do we even participate in people who facilitate Bitcoin.\u201d\nFast forward a few years and Wall Street has discovered that the blockchain technology enabling Bitcoin could save the industry tens of billions a year, so instead of throwing mudballs, they\u2019re now figuring out how to use the technology behind Bitcoin. \nI\u2019ve had two conversations with Goldman Sachs CEO Lloyd Blankfein about Bitcoin. In the first, back in 2013, he sort of sneered. In the second conversation, last year, he half-smiled and said, \u201cwe\u2019re looking at its technology.\u201d \nAt its most basic, a blockchain is a distributed database, a sort of ledger, that is protected with encryption and which allows the transfer of goods and services without middlemen. There are a lot of middlemen in the business of transferring payments.\nEarlier this week, Goldman Sachs filed a patent application for a new virtual currency it calls \u201cSETLcoin\u201d which uses blockchain technology.\nWith SETLcoin, Goldman Sachs imagines instantaneous execution and settlement \u201cfor exchanging assets, such as securities (e.g., stocks, bonds, etc.) cash, and/or cash equivalents via a peer-to-peer network\u201d according to it patent filing, wiping out the costs associated with these types of asset exchanges. \nGoldman isn\u2019t going to start doing business in Bitcoin instead of the dollar, euro or renminbi; it\u2019s taking lessons from Bitcoin and using the blockchain as the computer science protocol for its own cryptocurrency.\nIn the same way HTML became the protocol markup language for the World Wide Web, the blockchain may have the technological ingenuity to become the protocol for transactions where there is a need for a high level of trust.\nI expect Goldman Sachs to do away with one of Bitcoin\u2019s defining features: pseudo-anonymity. By using real names and identities on SETLcoin, Goldman Sachs would near-eliminate the kind of fraud and misuse that has plagued Bitcoin. \nThe cypherpunks and cryptolibertarians behind Bitcoin\u2019s creation and early adoption must be pulling their hair out. Bitcoin was created in the wake of the financial crisis to provide anonymous financial tools as an alternative to the dominant banking system. For Wall Street to now adopt its blockchain technology is deeply ironic and will probably become very, very profitable.\nAlec Ross is the author of The Industries of the Future, to be released in February by Simon & Schuster."}, {"author": "Alec Ross", "headline": "There's a Thanksgiving history lesson we often forget \u2014 but that's never been more relevant", "body": "Happy Thanksgiving! \nIn 1621, a hungry group of migrants who came to America for religious freedom the year before shared a meal with Native Americans from the Wampanoag tribe to give thanks for the pilgrims\u2019 first harvest, after arriving a year earlier with little to eat, too late in the season to grow crops. \nNearly 400 years later, families around the United States including my own will recreate that meal and give thanks for the blessings that life has given us. \nOn this Thanksgiving, I wanted to give thanks that a grandson of immigrants from Italy, Poland, Germany, England and Ukraine lives in a country where I have been able to grow successful and comfortable. \nI had to work for it. When I began my career, it was doing jobs like working as midnight janitor and delivering heavy kegs of beer in rural West Virginia working on a beer truck. Still, unlike many people beginning their careers in most places in the world, my country\u2019s politics and economics gave me a close-to-fair shot at becoming successful. It did not matter that I was the grandchild of migrants. \nIt\u2019s worth mentioning that among the developments for which I\u2019m thankful are tools like LinkedIn that allow people to connect in ways that were unimaginable 10 years ago. When I got that job on a beer truck, it was because the owner of the beer distributorship and my grandfather were both the sons of Italian immigrants, and that personal tie got me a job that I otherwise would not have gotten. \nTools like LinkedIn are creating more open marketplaces for work, and making labor less rooted in biology (who is your dad?) or sociology (which country club do you belong to?). Biology and sociology still matter, but the openness fostered by today\u2019s technology platforms make biology and sociology a little less deterministic. \nI hope that Americans gathered around the Thanksgiving dinner table remember that unless you are part of the less than 1% of Native Americans who make up our population today, that you are a descendent of immigrants. And while you, too, might have grown successful or (relatively) comfortable, there are many people in the world who need demonstrations of compassion like what the Wampanoag showed the pilgrims, teaching them how to farm and hunt in the new world. For hundreds of years, America has been made itself home to waves of migrants from England to Germany, Poland, Ireland, Italy, China, Vietnam, Cambodia, Mexico and dozens of other countries around the world who have fled poverty or political oppression. Your ancestors did not come to the United States if they were prospering in their homeland.\nAs we give thanks on Thanksgiving, let\u2019s remember from whence we come.\nAlec Ross is the author of The Industries of the Future, to be released in February by Simon & Schuster."}][{"author": "Yasi Baiani", "headline": "Advice for the New Grads", "body": "I\u2019ve been invited to join the UC Berkeley Commencement Ceremony this weekend as a member of the faculty who has students graduating from the Haas School of Business, MBA Program this spring.\nThis invitation is such an honor for me, and it is one of the most memorable invitations I\u2019ve ever received in my life. And I had received some memorable invitations in the past, such as last year\u2019s invitation from Mrs. Michelle Obama to join her and President Obama at the White House to celebrate Iranian New Year (Norouz) as one of our nation\u2019s Iranian-American thought leaders.\nThe invitation to join Berkeley\u2019s commencement is special to me for two primary reasons:\n1) This past spring was my first time teaching. I had the opportunity of teaching the Product Management course, which I had designed from scratch, to the MBA students at Haas School of Business, UC Berkeley. Now, watching my students walk down the stage, proud to complete their higher education degree from such a fine institution, feels rewarding and satisfactory.\n2) It was only 11 years ago that I myself walked the same stage, graduated from UC Berkeley as an undergraduate. I once again can feel the exuberance I experienced that day. As a first member of my family immigrated to the United States and barely spoke any English at that point, graduating from UC Berkeley was out of realm of possibilities. But I did it! I did it with lots of hard work and struggles. I did it because I didn't let myself believe that limitations could hold me back. My mentality was to solve issues and remove hurdles rather than give in to them.  \nAfter graduation, I had no idea what I would end up doing in my life in the years to come. I surely had no idea which institutions I would end up joining next (Harvard, Fitbit, AthenaHealth, etc), what amazing people I would end up working with and what kinds of personal and professional challenges I would face along the way. As one of my heroes and role models, Steve Jobs, noted, \u201cYou can't connect the dots looking forward; you can only connect them looking backwards.\u201d\nToday, I can look back and connect the dots of the last decade. By working in four different industries (digital health, venture capital, investment banking, and academia), being involved with over a dozen for-profit and nonprofit organizations, living in various parts of the world, overcoming personal challenges, celebrating successes, facing family issues, and cherishing some special moments in life, I learned some key lessons that I would like to share with the newly graduated students. I hope you can take these points and be a few steps ahead of where I started when I graduated: \n1) Be a human above and beyond any other role you accept: We all take many roles in our lives: father, mother, daughter, son, teacher, investor, writer, friend, wife, sister, brother, advisor, advocate, doctor, coder, administrator, mentor, board member, president, CEO, founder and the list goes on.\nWe do some of these roles better than the others. What\u2019s sad is that a lot of times people lose their humanity and compassion along the way, their sense of caring for others. I want to encourage you to always be human above and beyond any other role you may hold.      \n2) Listen to your heart and follow your passion: Listening to your heart and doing what you love will lead to true happiness which most of the time is SO hard to achieve.\n3) Discover your life mission: Living a mission-driven life allows you to wake up everyday and go to ANY battle because you know what you are doing is important. Having clear life mission empowers you to say NO to things that are not aligned with your goals and missions. That makes your decision making process so much easier and your life more fulfilling. Life is too short to do things that you don\u2019t value.\n4) Define the metrics of success for your life: Many of us tend to set goals and metrics of success for our companies, products, etc. However, a lot of times we are overwhelmed with our demanding day-to-day lives and forget to set goals and metrics for our own lives; we forget to ask questions like:\nWhat do I value the most?\nWhat kind of life do I want to have?\nDo I want family or not? What about career?\nDo I care to spend time with my parents, friends, etc?\nDo I want to be the best father or the best astronaut? What are the tradeoffs if any?\nTo get better in setting and tracking your life metrics, I would recommend that you read \u201cHow Will You Measure Your Life\u201d, the book from the reputable Harvard Business School Professor, Clay Christensen.\n5) Stand behind what\u2019s right: This could be challenging at times and subjective in many cases. But use your best judgment and always support what\u2019s right. It will eventually pay off.  \n6) Try to put yourself in other person\u2019s shoes before any action or reaction: Every time you want to criticize someone or have a harsh response to them, take a breath and put yourself in their shoes; I can guarantee that your reactions will be different 90% of the times. Adhere to the golden rule and treat others how you want to be treated.\n7) Try to be helpful and it will go a long way: If you develop the mentality of being helpful first and foremost - before thinking about what is in it for you, things may have surprisingly positive outcomes for you. With that attitude, others naturally will be gravitated to you; they want to be your friend; they want to be on your teams. These will lead to having a tight network of family, friends, colleagues, and teams that will make your life fulfilling, rewarding, and worth living.\n8) Be unstoppable, yet flexible. Life is tough, so you need to be tough too! Throughout your life and career you might face countless challenges and need to overcome them. Life has unexpected surprises - some are very good and other not so much. You should not let challenges and hardships stop you from pushing forward to the best of your abilities. On the other hand, you want to be flexible to changes or else you will constantly hit at the wall. Flexibility in your thinking and attitude allows you to find a door or window to pass through rather than hit a wall.\n9) Use challenges as opportunities\u2026 and don\u2019t give up: If you view any challenge you face as an opportunity to learn and get better, you will be much happier person and more in peace with yourself.\n10) Don\u2019t just say you want something, strategize how you can get there: Then put your mind and energy behind it.  \nCONGRATULATIONS to all the new graduates -- particularly to my students -- and their families. Graduating from college is a big life milestone and one that doesn't come without a lot of hard work, commitment, and family support. Congratulations for reaching to the finish line! I'm certain each of you will have a great life ahead and will get a chance to take many steps towards making the world a better place. Live your life to the fullest and be awesome! \n\n\n\n      "}, {"author": "Yasi Baiani", "headline": "Secret of Goal Setting & Achieving Them", "body": "Happy 2017! Another year and another opportunity to reset, re-center, and regain the control of your life. Science shows that setting goals increases the chance of achievements. It gives you sense of direction and purpose and motivates you to work towards your goals.\nI wrote another blog post about \u201cTips for Reaching Your Goals\u201d last year. Here, I wanted to add a few points to help you set more meaningful goals for 2017 and increase your chances of success in achieving them.  \nI set seven goals in 2016 and reached five out of seven already, and there\u2019s a good chance I can complete one more in early 2017 (so a bit later than 2016, but directionally I\u2019m on the right track). So I\u2019m almost at 85% goal completion rate for 2016. This is slightly higher than my goal completion rate of 80% in 2015. What\u2019s important though, is that my goals in 2016 were 5x more difficult to achieve than my 2015 goals. So how was I able to keep the goal completion rate so high? Here are a few secrets to share with you:\n1) Have a short list of things you really want to achieve: Don\u2019t let your 2017 goals become a long list of wishes and nice-to-have things. Life is too busy and it\u2019s hard to focus on your goals if those are not just a few very clear ones. If you are a newbie in goal setting process, don\u2019t go beyond five goals for the whole year. If you have done goal settings before and had good success, you may have a longer list. In general, I recommend the shorter and more concise list of goals.\n2) Pick a goal that you \u201creally\u201d care about: If you want do something so bad you will go above and beyond to make it happen. I have a friend of mine who lost 40 lbs in 6 months. She really, so badly wanted to lose her extra weight, and she did it! She was so committed to her goal that every time we went out for dinner or even when I cooked her favorite food she didn\u2019t even taste it. She said, \u201cI have a goal and in order to reach that I need to stay to the course.\u201d That\u2019s the type of commitment needed to reach BIG goals!  \n3) Make your goals as measurable as possible: Do you see a number in your goal statement? If not, it\u2019s not measurable enough. Make sure your goal statement has a number, date, and frequency; without those it\u2019s hard to assess if you hit your goal or not.\nHere are some examples of measurable goals:\na) I want to exercise 222 days out of 365 days of the year. That\u2019s about exercising 4 out of 7 days a week. You can measure this by logging your exercise everyday and know if you are on track or not in a weekly and monthly basis.\nAn alternative to this would have been \u201cI want to exercise more in 2017\u201d. As you can see, the second version is vague and not measurable.  \nb) I want to improve my relationship with my significant other by texting her 3 nice texts everyday and go to a date with her every month. Do you think this is measurable enough?\nc) I want to become a more effective financial analyst by decreasing time spent on excel sheet by 15% per day by the end of Q2 while completing the same type of reports as before. Do you think this is a good goal statement?\n4) Assign categories to your goals to have a balanced list: To have a well-rounded, fulfilled life, you need to focus on more than just one dimension. For instance, if you have all your 2017 goals as professional goals, you may end the year feeling your personal health and relationships are suffering. In order to have a balanced set of goals for the year, try to break them down into categories.\nAs an example, my 2017 goals are under three buckets: 1) personal; 2) family & friends; and 3) professional. The personal category are things that I want to do to make me feel better as an individual or help me grow. An example could be practicing Spanish everyday on your way to work with Duolingo with the goal of being 25% fluency rate by the end of the year (Duolingo gives fluency rate which enables \u201cmeasuring\u201d your goal / achievement).\nThe family and friends category are anything that I want to do for my immediate family, friends, colleague, and people I interact with. For me, I realized that my 2016 became so busy with work, speaking at conferences, delivering big projects, and my immediate family that I spent a lot less time with friends and colleagues that I would like to. My 2017 resolution is to not only allocate more time with my friends and colleagues, but also increase my compassion in general towards everyone in my circle. I want to make sure I carve out time to listen to a story of a stranger who needs someone to listen and care; I want to go visit that sick family friend who needs someone to open her door and say \u201cI\u2019m here to see YOU\u201d. As a result, one of my goals under this category is to do 12 things (once per month) that I or almost 90% of people won\u2019t carve out time to do in a regular busy days. I want to do 12 acts of kindness.\nI hope this post is a good inspiration for you to also set (and write down) your 2017 goals and take steps to make them happen through out the year, one at a time. Wishing you a wonderful year ahead. Now, go set your goals if you haven't already!"}, {"author": "Yasi Baiani", "headline": "Product Analysis: What Contributes to Uber's Extraordinary Success", "body": "[This blog post is based on my personal view and does not in any way reflect the opinions of the current organization I work for].\nBuilding a unicorn company is extremely challenging; creating a decacorn business (valued over $10bn) is pretty much beyond imagination. Uber, with over $65bn valuation, is one of the few decacorn tech companies of this decade. In the journey of becoming a multi-billion dollar company, Uber founders, executives, and teams have done so many things right. Their exceptionally fast growth, high economic impact, powerful user value, and superior product experience are great things to analyze and learn from.\nThere are plenty of great analyses on the reasons behind Uber\u2019s exceptional triumph, including the ruthless attitude of Uber\u2019s founder, the company's successful growth hacking and demand creation strategy, and its effective approach of building a 2-sided market led by industry experts such as Andrew Chen. Taking a different perspective, in this article I decided to primarily focus on Uber as a product. Below are six reasons that Uber\u2019s product contributed to the company\u2019s success:  \n1) No hailing; no waiting: The best thing about Uber is that it solves a real problem. Pre-Uber time, taking a cab could be an exasperating experience. When you called for a cab, you could end up waiting anywhere between 10-45 minutes. A lot of times the cab driver who accepted your request would change his mind and never show up; you had no way to know, as there was no direct interaction between a passenger and a driver -- all the communications happened through a taxi dispatch, and there was no map to track the driver like there is today on the Uber app.   \nAnother option for getting a cab was to hail one on the street. However, despite having the availability light on, there was never any guarantee that the cab was actually available. Sometimes drivers forgot to change the status of their availability light. Other times they just weren\u2019t in the mood to take you.\nUber came in and with its product offering solved all the main customer pain points for taking a ride. It enables users to request a cab via an application on their phones. It connects drivers and passengers directly rather than having a call center in between. Uber consistently offers reliable pick up time, calculated by Uber algorithms based on the number of drivers available in each area, their distance to a passenger, user rating, traffic, and other factors. The combination of these features took away the pain of taking a cab and made it a pleasant experience.\nLesson Learned: Solve a real problem; solve a big problem...and the rest will follow.     \n2) Zero second payment process: Prior to Uber, the point of sales (payment time) was one of the most cumbersome parts of a taxi ride. In a lot of cases, the taxi\u2019s archaic credit card machine would fail at the time the driver wanted to charge the passenger. Then the driver had to reboot the machine and hope it worked. This would resulted a long wait time which was neither pleasant for the driver nor the passenger.\nBecause of these challenges and the cut the credit card companies would take out of each charge, drivers desired cash payments; however, many passengers didn\u2019t carry enough cash. This always created tension between drivers and passengers.   \nUber came in and, with its auto-payment system, made the process of paying for a ride seamless. It guarantees drivers will get paid since each passenger must have a valid credit card on file in order for their Uber app to be functional; it also brought the time to pay for a ride to zero seconds. (Who can beat that?!) Passengers get out of the car and Uber automatically charges the user\u2019s credit card on file.\nLesson Learned: Solve a real problem from multiple angles. Can you fix more than one thing for your customers?\n3) Only three clicks to request a cab: After creating a profile on Uber (a one time event), a passenger can always order a cab with only three clicks: 1) enter a pick up address 2) tap on \u201cset pickup location\u201d 3) request an UberX -- or any other tier of service the user prefers.\nThe ease of use and minimum steps required to order a cab is the art of Uber\u2019s product design. The simplicity and intuitiveness of Uber\u2019s product led to growth of the company because anyone, even non-tech-savvy users, can easily use the Uber application.   \nLesson Learned: If you want to build a product that eventually targets everyone in the world, design for simplicity and ease of use.\n4) Minimum information presented in each screen: \u201cLess is more\u201d is another admirable product approach Uber takes. If you\u2019ve noticed, you only see the minimum information needed at each stage of using the Uber app; all the \u201cnice-to-have\u201d pieces are cut from the app\u2019s core experience.  \nWhile ordering a cab, the user only sees: two fields to enter the pickup and drop-off addresses, number of cabs nearby, the estimated time one could get to her, and the tier of Uber services to select from (UberX, Pool, etc). Also, Uber takes away additional work from the user by guessing her pick up address and always keeping the default tier of service to what the user chooses most often.\nWhen waiting for a cab, the user only sees the location of the cab at any given moment, the car model, and the driver\u2019s name, so that the passenger can easily locate her ride when it arrives. One thing that could be improved in this part of the app is the interaction for contacting a driver; the contact button is hidden and only accessible by tapping on the driver\u2019s name.\nWhen the ride is finished, the user only sees the charge amount and the option to rate and review the driver.\nLesson Learned: When you design a product, always assume less is more and be disciplined to show the minimum yet most useful information to users.\n5) Tracking on the map: This feature is probably one of the most valuable parts of the Uber experience. Creating this level of transparency about where your ride is at any given time is something that took away some of the main pain points of requesting a ride (see the first bullet point) and distinguished Uber from traditional cabs. The ability to track your ride on the map is a central part of the Uber experience; thus, Uber rightfully allocated more than two thirds of the screen to the map in the Uber app.\nLesson Learned: Identify the core feature(s) of your product and make sure they are a central part of the user experience in your product design.\n6) Make your back-end and algorithms smart: One of the most powerful parts of the Uber experience is its reliability and accuracy. Imagine requesting an Uber ride that shows you a pick-up time of 2 minutes but in reality it takes 20 minutes for your ride to arrive. How frustrating and unreliable that would be?! Behind Uber\u2019s simple UI are the well-designed algorithms that you never see but that power the user experience.\nLesson Learned: Don\u2019t shy away from investing in your algorithms and AI. They may not be user-facing, but they have significant impact on the user experience and credibility of your product."}, {"author": "Yasi Baiani", "headline": "5 Steps to Build a Customer-Driven Product & Company", "body": "There are multiple ways to approach the process of building a product. Different product owners (either product managers or entrepreneurs) have different strategies. Some will just go with their intuition about customers and market needs while others simply assume that their own problem must be that of others and go about building a product to address that problem. Although these might be good starting points, the process of assessing the validity of an idea shouldn\u2019t stop there. In fact, user and data driven product design and development is the only way to build top notch products that will take off!\nHenry Ford once said, \u201cIf I had asked people what they wanted, they would have said faster horses.\u201d Ford\u2019s adage may seem to contradict my point that user and data driven product design is best - that, in reality, users may not actually know what they want.\nHowever, based on my experience building innovative and cutting edge products that are used and loved by millions of people, I can guarantee that if a product owner listens hard enough and long enough to potential users she can learn what users want and, more importantly, what they don\u2019t want. Users may not hand the product owner a vision or the solution, but they will surely point her in the right direction.\nIn fact, the customer\u2019s voice is king in product development! To help you understand this more fully, I have outlined 5 essential steps to build a customer driven product development process and organization:     \n1. Customer\u2019s voice should be echoed from all parts of the organization: Let the customer\u2019s voice be channeled to your product team from all parts of your organization especially sales, marketing, and customer service teams. These groups are in the front line, working with customers and gaining lots of insights into what customers need or like. Thus, these teams\u2019 feedback should be key in defining and designing your product.  \n2. Make various research methods part of your development DNA: There are various tools and techniques that enable a customer driven product development mentality. Some of these tools include surveys, user interviews, usability testing, prototype testing, and beta testing. All these techniques lead to the collection of qualitative or quantitative information that should shape product decisions and designs.\nEach of these methods are most effective at different phases of product development. For instance, user interviews are best used in early phase of product development to help the product owner understand user\u2019s sentiment around a particular topic. On the other hand, usability testing comes later in the product development process when designs are already available. Usability testing helps identify whether the designs offered are intuitive or not.  \nIn order to build an experience that people will really love and embrace, you should use more than one of these research methods before building any product.\n3. Test strategy before launch strategy: Generally product owners think about when and how they want to launch a feature or product. But many times they forget to clearly lay out their pre-launch testing strategy. Testing any feature or product before launch is key for gaining confidence in its quality and performance; thus, the product owner should clearly lay out the testing plan and incorporate the time necessary for testing into her product development timeline.\nVarious types of testings should happen in different phases of product development. Each test will provide different types of insight and information for the product owner. For instance, early prototype testing with real users enables the product owner to see if her original idea and the way it is designed seems appealing to the target customers or not. On the other hand, beta stage product testing should come right before the product launch, and it is meant to catch the final bugs and perfect the last versions of the product. One should expect that the final product will be quite different than the early prototypes ( as you collect more data you will improve your product), but there should be minimal changes to the product between beta and launch.\nTesting the product early and often allows you to land on the perfect product market fit. So piloting your product with your early adopters or your cheerleading customers is one of the most important steps in product development.\n4. Let data speak stronger than opinions: Many product owners fall into the trap of letting their gut feeling or ego drive the product development process. Although it\u2019s great to have confidence in your vision and plan, it\u2019s critical to set assumptions and test your idea against those assumptions. Collect data and be honest with yourself about what that data is representing. It\u2019s sometimes easy to get emotional about your idea and ignore data, even when data is available. Letting data prove your vision is the best route to build successful products quickly and with minimum development cost. \n5. Kill the solution not the problem: A lot of times the product owner\u2019s observation for a problem in the world is the right one. However, finding the right solution for that problem may not always be a simple answer. If data doesn\u2019t support the original solution, the product owner and her team should slightly change the solution and pivot until they end up with the right solution that addresses the original problem they discovered.  \nPut these tips into testing and apply them to your product development process. Let me know the results. Please share your insight and experience about the product development process - whether it\u2019s similar or different. The discussion could help benefit everyone."}, {"author": "Yasi Baiani", "headline": "How to Get More Women to the Top", "body": "The lack of women in the executive levels of companies is not a secret anymore. This topic has been widely discussed as a major problem for individuals, companies, and societies.\nDespite various researchers such as the one conducted with Peterson Institute for International Economics that showed an increase in the number of women from 0 to 30 percent would be associated with a 15 percent rise in profitability, there is still a very slow progress on changing the demographic of the c-suite and boardrooms.\nThe same research from the Peterson Institute on 22,000 companies in 91 countries showed that 60 percent of companies had no female board members and over 50 percent of them had no female executive. Just under 5 percent had a female CEO. In the same study, American companies had only 12 percent of board seats going to women and 16 percent of executive positions.\nAs you can see, these numbers for the 21st century, are nothing but shocking, embarrassing, and disappointing!\nGiven that there has been so much written on \u201cthe problem\u201d itself, I want to shy away from writing about \u201cthe problem\u201d again! But rather, I would prefer to focus on \u201cthe solutions.\u201d Because I strongly believe that everyone in all parts of organizations and societies can take steps to change these numbers and improve outcomes.\nI decided to break down this post to two parts: Part One, which is the one you are reading now, will offer practical solutions to men and women who are in the managerial and executive levels. Part Two, which will be published later, will offer tactical solutions to women and men who are earlier in their careers.\nWhat can you do as a male high level executive or mid-level manager to change the ratios?\n- Keep your biases in check: we all know that inevitably each of us has biases that were shaped based on our experiences and exposures in life. Although it\u2019s hard to fully eliminate our biases, being aware of them and consciously control them could significantly change the decisions we make as individuals. For instance, men tend to pay more attention and give more credit to points brought up in meetings or conferences by other men than those brought up by women. Also, both men and women have more tendency to go grab lunch or coffee with the same gender at work. These are subtle and small biases that overtime could have big impacts.\nNext time you are in a meeting try to have more eye contact with other female colleagues and give their ideas as equal credit as you would to those of your male colleagues. If you are a speaker on a panel, make sure to do the same thing. As a male executive invite your female direct reports to grab lunch or drinks with you, if you do that with their male counterparts.\n- Think twice before rejecting a female candidate: It\u2019s also proven that people tend to hire people similar to themselves. For male high level executives and mid-level managers it\u2019s critical to be conscious of this and ensure that you are not rejecting a talented and qualified female candidate just because she may not be similar to you.\nLosing talents due to these biases is extremely sad and could have negative business consequences -- because we know diversity improves financial outcomes.  An easy solution is before rejecting a female candidate, do an honest check with yourself and ensure no personal biases is impacting your decision.\n- Put an extra effort in identifying female talents in your company and promoting them: At the Wisdom 2.0 conference this year, Natalia Oberti Noguera, the Founder and CEO, Pipeline Fellowship, mentioned that research showed men get promoted based on \"potential\" and women get promoted based on \"performance\". This is a sad piece of information and one that I hope high level male executives take a direct action and put conscious effort to change.\nGiven that the battle for finding top talent will only get more intense in many industries such as tech and healthcare, it\u2019s critical for executives and mid-level managers to identify talented female employees and put an extra effort to keep and promote them. This allows the company to benefit from an untapped market of high potential female talents and leaders as well as unleash their extraordinary potential to drive top and bottom lines.\nWhat can you do as a female high level executive or mid-level manager to change the ratios?\n- Be a great role model: Given that you are part of a very small pool of female executives or mid-level managers, many high potential women, earlier in their careers, are closely watching you and might be trying to follow your foot-prints. Continue lean in and be that role model, so that more women can materialize and visualize that getting to the top is a possibility for them.  \n- Don\u2019t be afraid to stand for other women: A lot of times I heard from high level female managers and executives that they were worried to stand for hiring or promoting another woman. They were concerned that this comes across as a favor of a woman to another woman.\nLet\u2019s be more courageous than that. Let\u2019s stand for merit and talent versus gender differences. Let\u2019s build a strong pipeline of women as there is so much room for improvement and growth at every level of every organization for women. \n- Be a champion of change and improvements in your company: As a high level female executive or mid-level manager, no one could be a better champion for this topic than you. If you are in those positions try to bring up and implement changes about females\u2019 promotions, females\u2019 mentorships, maternity/paternity leave policies, and day care system among many other topics that require attention in order to keep and cultivate female talents in your company. \n- Mentor high potential female candidates: We all know that a good mentor could change an individual's life and career path. I\u2019ve personally been fortunate to have many male and female mentors who significantly impact my career.\nOne important reality is that as of today, the number of women in the top executive levels are very small. Therefore, many high potential women are struggling to find the right female role model, much less one who has time and willingness to train them and mentor them.\nIf you are a woman at the top executive level or high level managerial roles, see if you could open some time in your busy schedule to mentor women in your company or other women who may reach out to you. I\u2019m certain any hour a young talented woman spends with people like you, their chances of success and reaching to the top could substantially increase.\nChange starts slow, and could start from each of us!\nChange starts small, but its outcome could be big!\nDon\u2019t you want to be part of and pioneer of something big?!\nThen join the movement, lean in, have an impact, and share this with others in your network to invite them to participate as well."}, {"author": "Yasi Baiani", "headline": "Tips for Reaching Your Goals in 2016", "body": "Happy 2016! Do you have new resolutions for 2106? How do you go about setting those milestones? Based on your previous year resolutions and their outcomes, do you feel satisfied by the methods you applied in the past? \nThe start of the New Year is a good time to think about what you want to accomplish in the coming months. Perhaps you have already committed to a New Year's resolution, which is a good start.\nHowever, resolutions tend to be all or nothing. Resolution is a decision or determination to do something. A lot of times, as part of our resolution, we actually tend to focus on what we don't want to do -- quitting carbohydrates this year -- rather than what we do want to achieve. Most importantly, most of the new year resolutions tend to be short-term and don't have a solid strategy on how to sustain them for a whole year and beyond. Perhaps that's why only 8% of people who make a New Year's resolution actually keep it.\nInstead, goals are the result toward which effort is directed. They tend to be longer term, and there is a need for a good strategy or execution plan in order to achieve them. \nI personally don't set new year resolutions. Instead, in the last few years, I always set big goals at the beginning of the year. The following tactics really helped me to deliver over 80% of my personal and professional goals that I set for myself at the beginning of the year. Try them out and see how they work for you in 2016:\nSecret of Prioritization: First, list everything that you are hoping to achieve in that year; then make the list shorter so it's not more than 5 or 6 items. A short list will help you to always remember your goals for the year.\nClear & Measurable: Make your goals crystal clear with specifics, timelines, and measurable outcomes. That's the only way you can track if you hit your goal or not.\nSpell Them Out: In order to keep track of your multiple goals over a year and don't forget about the specifics you set, it's highly recommended to jot them down somewhere that only you can have access to. For some people, they actually prefer to put their goals in front of them (post them on their bedroom or bathroom wall), so they see it every day. For others, they prefer to keep it private. \nSet Smaller Milestones: If it will help you to have smaller goals to see how you are progressing towards that bigger goal, you can set some monthly or quarterly milestones for yourself. My suggestion is that don't add those as part of your list of top goals or else your main list will get long and busy, so it will be harder to keep track of the big goals.  \nBreak Them Down into Multi-year Goals: Some goals are big enough that you need to break them down into multi-year goals. For instance, if you are a freshman in college, your goal by the end of the year can't realistically be graduation. However, you can set clear, actionable, and measurable goals for this year that could help you with a successful graduation with top grades and resume in a few years. \nHave an Execution Plan: It's not just important to set a goal, but more importantly you have to have clear idea on how you aim to work towards achieving that goal.\nBe Flexible: Life will still bring us its ups and downs and surprises along the way. So it's impossible to predict all it has to offer us at the beginning of the year and plan everything accordingly. Be open to new information you will receive during the year and adjust some of your goals if necessary.\nThese goal setting technics really helped me in the last few years. Give them a try in 2016 and keep me posted on the outcomes. If others have different tips and tricks that worked well for them in the past, please share them below with other readers.\nHave a fabulous and productive year everyone! "}, {"author": "Yasi Baiani", "headline": "How to Build the Next Unicorn in Healthcare", "body": "[This blog post is based on my personal view and does not in any way reflect the opinions of the current organization I work for].\nRecently, RockHealth published an article, talking about \u201cWhy there is no Uber in Healthcare?\u201d Also, Aileen Lee\u2019s more recent Unicorn Analysis from the Summer of 2015, showed that out of 84 existing unicorns*, only a handful are in the health sector including Zenefits, Oscar Health, and Zocdoc.\nTypically, building a unicorn company is super challenging with odds being against the founders every single day. This difficulty magnifies ten times more, when we are speaking about building a unicorn in the land of healthcare, given its regulations and archaic systems that are established and hard to change.  \nDespite all the challenges, some entrepreneurs have actually succeeded to build unicorns in healthcare. Given my entrepreneurial spirit and can-do attitude, I would like to believe that in the next five years we will see a lot more digital health unicorns born and scale.  \nHere, I would like to give you some tactical tips to help you build a unicorn digital health startup that delivers high value and that changes healthcare for better:    \n1) Understand the current healthcare system: The best entrepreneurs and founders have great understanding of their sectors; healthcare is no exception. If you don\u2019t understand the current system well, how you want to lead your company to offer something better than others, something that it\u2019s guaranteed to be adapted and used by different players in the healthcare system, will it be the physicians, insurance companies, or consumers/patients!?   \nWhile a clear understanding of the current healthcare system is essential, you also need to be aware that changing the status quo will always face resistance. You need to be ready to address those resistance you will face in healthcare quickly in order to scale your business. To give you an example, physicians have an established process when they see a patient. Many of them would show resistance to introduce a new step in their workflow such as reading wearables\u2019 information to better understand their patient\u2019s 24/7 health performance.\nAs a healthcare entrepreneur, it\u2019s your job to understand these types of hurdles, resistances, and biases in the healthcare system in advance of your product launch and find ways to navigate through them.\n2) Know your customers: Getting into your customers' head and understanding their psychology behind any purchasing decision is key for success of any company. Despite success of on-demand businesses such as Uber, Airbnb, and Instacart and their explosive growth, on-demand healthcare companies still are in a much slower growth trajectory. You may ask why...\nOne reason is that when it comes to health, consumers aren\u2019t as open to try new and unknown services. Additionally, many users may perceive the quality of health services that can be provided at an established, full-on health center to be much higher than what can be delivered via video-chat or from a doctor-on-the-go, who will visit you at your home. How do you design your product, brand, and company, so that you can overcome such perceptions and challenges?\n3) Have product hooks: In order for your product or service to be successful and deliver atypical growth needed to build a unicorn, you need to build \u201chooks\u201d that bring your users back over and over to your platform. (If you haven\u2019t read Hook from Nir Eyal, I highly recommend it).\nIn my view, Facebook has done this better than any other company. Each new feature is a strong hook that contributes to the product stickiness and increases user engagement. That\u2019s why over one billion people go to Facebook in a daily basis. It\u2019s addictive and filled with hooks. What are your product hooks for your digital health company?  \n4) Have a clear monetization strategy and understand your customers\u2019 willingness-to-pay: At the end of the day, cash is king! Businesses that succeed in the long term pump revenues (and ideally profits) like no others. As a founder of a healthcare company, it\u2019s super important that you have a clear monetization path from early on and rigorously test your monetization assumptions. Given that historically payers and consumers/patients have been different entities in healthcare, building a direct-to-consumer business with expectation that consumers instead of insurances will pay for your service now has its own challenges.\nAdditionally, if you offer a B2B product or service, consider how you help businesses \u201csave money\u201d. That\u2019s the best way to easily convince enterprises to pay for your product or service. If all you have to offer is a \u201cbetter\u201d product or service, but not per se a more cost effective one, your sale cycles will be much longer, and it will take you more time to become a unicorn if at all.\n5) Know the rules and regulations: Healthcare is filled with rules and regulations. Some reasonable, some totally archaic and non-sense. At the end of the day though, as an entrepreneur in this sector, you need to know those rules really well and find ways to navigate through them. You may decide to push the boundaries on some of the rules, but make sure that you do them smartly. Zenefit is a good example of a healthcare unicorn that\u2019s now struggling and getting hit for not following the rules; Theranos is another multi-billion dollar healthcare company under the scrutiny due to the lack of transparency and for providing misleading information.  \n6) What\u2019s your unfair competitive advantage? As an entrepreneur in any sector you need to have a competitive advantage that allows you to build your company faster than other founders. How can you do that? If you answer \u201cyes\u201d to more than one of the questions below, you probably have a competitive edge:\nDo you have an unique knowledge into the healthcare sector that allows you to build a right product with the best hooks faster than others?\nDo you have unfair access to a pull of talent and can hire best people faster than others?\nDo you know the right investors with big pockets who are willing to invest in you and your idea?\nAre you a hustler and ruthless executor like no-one else?  \nAre you a visionary and a solution finder?\n\nGiven that it\u2019s really hard for any entrepreneur to be outstanding in all the dimensions mentioned above from product to regulations, I highly recommend that you surround yourself with top notch advisors (more than one) who have great understanding of the healthcare system. They could help you stay out of trouble and succeed building a long-lasting unicorn.\nIf you are a healthcare entrepreneur, please share your views and experiences in the comments below. If you are an aspiring entrepreneur, I hope this spark some ideas and give you useful tips to apply to your next venture.\n* Unicorns are referred to companies whose valuation has exceeded $1 billion dollars."}, {"author": "Yasi Baiani", "headline": "Land a Job That Fits You Like Second Skin", "body": "In the busy and fast-paced of western world, most of us probably spend more time working than doing any other activities (e.g. sleeping, exercising, relaxing, spending quality time with our families and friends). So we might as well do what we love rather than just do \u201csomething\u201d or hold \u201ca\u201d job.  \nThe spark for this blog post came from an overwhelming number of questions, calls, and emails I received within the last year from friends, friends of friends, and strangers who wanted to learn more about how I landed a role that I\u2019m super passionate about and how I decided to join Fitbit versus other companies -- the second question came from people who knew me closely and were aware of different opportunities I was assessing. Thus, I decided to share my experience with a broader group here to inspire and empower others to seek what they are most passionate about and to help them reach their dreams, whatever that might be. Below are five fundamental concepts that I believe will help you find a job that fits you like second skin:\n1) Discover and follow your passion: The beauty of working on what you are super excited about is that work feels like play. Additionally, if you are passionate about what you work on, you will spend more time thinking about the problems in that field and coming up with better solutions than other people who don\u2019t have the same passion. This will give you significant edge and competitive advantage over time.\n2) Know your strengths and chose a role accordingly: Being aware of what your strengths and best skills are is an invaluable insight. That awareness will allow you to not only pick a role that you are most excited about, but also one at which you can deliver significant business values.\n3) Pursue the passion that\u2019s in a high growth industry: Despite the fact that Ben Horowitz is one of my heroes and role models, my knee jerk reaction to his Columbia University commencement speech on \u201cDon\u2019t Follow Your Passion\u201d was that what the hell is he talking about! That\u2019s the worst advice you can give to new graduates! However, after listening to his talk and pondering his points, I can\u2019t agree with him more.\nIf you find your passion in an industry that\u2019s shrinking or dying, it will be a lot more challenging to have a high impact and successful career.  The good news is that most of us have more than one passion. What you need to do to discover your passions is to go through a deep self-discovery experience. As part of that process, there are some of the questions you need to answer (and try to be really honest with yourself):\nWhat makes you tick in life?\nWhat are your hobbies?  \nWhat were the things you liked to do as a kid?\nWhat technologies, products, or experiences excite you?\n\n4) Shape and express your point of view about your industry: One of my favorite professors at Harvard, Professor Gunnar Trumbull, gave us valuable career advice that has stuck with me. He told us that we would each reach the height of our career if and when we become experts in our field. He said that when people call you up to ask your advice on a particular topic, that\u2019s when you know you\u2019re on the right path. In other words, you need to be a brand, something that you stand for!\nThere are many ways to build your expertise. Here are a few tactical tips to help you develop your knowledge and build your brand:\nRead, research, and experiment a ton in the area that you are passionate about.\nShape your point of view on what will work and what not in your area of focus.\nShare your knowledge and view with others by commenting on forums such as Quora, where people seek other's expertise, writing blog posts on topics that you are passionate about, and speaking at relevant events.\n5) Have your criteria straight to be able to say \u201cno\u201d to the wrong opportunities: If you don\u2019t know what type of role or industry you would like to land on, it will be very hard to make it a reality. It\u2019s like people who want to be in a serious relationship, but have no idea what their type is! It\u2019s absolutely fine to spend some time and explore, but at some point you need to set your criteria.  \nYour criteria could totally change over time, but you need to clearly know what you want at any given time in order to make reasonable (vs. emotional) decisions. You don\u2019t want to say \u201cyes\u201d to every job offer you\u2019ll receive, just like you wouldn\u2019t want to say \u201cyes\u201d to any guy or girl who wants to go out with you.\nSome of the criteria that are important to sort out for your next career move are the followings:\nIn what role or department could you add the most value: engineering, product, design, marketing, business development, corporate development, etc.?\nIn what industry would you like to work?\nWhat size company will fit you best: seed-round, Series A, B, C, growth company, or a public company?  \nWhat type of culture would best fit your personality and work style?\nWhat are your deal breakers?\nWhat job attributes will most contribute to your overall happiness: location, opportunity for growth, compensation, job security, title, opportunity for learning, mentorship, etc.? \nIn order to make the right career choice that brings you satisfaction and happiness and that meets most of your personal and professional criteria, I highly recommend that you figure out your list of criteria first, and then stick to it.      \nI truly hope each and everyone of you who are reading this post and pondering if you are at the right role or company, or if you could instead maximize your talent and passion elsewhere, start a self-discovery journey and find what\u2019s the best fit for you soon.

A good example of such robots is Roomba, iRobot vacuum cleaner, which automatically cleans homes of millions of common people who own one of these robots.   \nIn the next decade, we\u2019ll see the robots\u2019 impacts will exponentially increase in our lives and they will seamlessly become part of our everyday lives. Although that seems kind of scary, my bet is that, like all other new technologies, the net benefits of robots will overweight the downside. Below are a few ways that I can envision robots will find their ways into our homes:\n1) Substitute the on-demand workers in the sharing economy: As you may know, Uber has heavily invested in the self-driving cars and poached 40 of the top robotic talents & scientists from one of the most credible robotics research institutes, Carnegie Mellon University. From the Uber\u2019s recent moves, it\u2019s clear that the company is committed to swap its drivers with robots in the near future.\nIt\u2019s not hard to imagine that robots will find their way into many sharing economy companies that their service providers have very routine tasks. Think of Instacart shoppers, Alfred, and Washio Ninjas as a potential candidates. As long as we can get the walking and fully functional robots that could be programed for chores, they could be provided with the addresses, orders, and tasks and sent out to do their jobs. It\u2019s important to note that getting to a point that we have fully functional and independent robots it\u2019s not a trivial process. However, the exciting news is that with all the researches, developments, and investments in the robotics we are getting closer to this.    \n2) Robots will be integrated into the IoT at homes: Think Roomba meets Nest becomes a reality! Scientists from MIT Media Labs, to industry pioneers (iRobots Founders) and behemoth tech companies such as Apple and Google are working hard and spending millions of dollars to make this wild dream a reality.\nWith the expansion of IoT and connected home devices as well as advancement of robots, it\u2019s promising to have a Robot Maid in the next decade. Imagine you can program your robot to cook and serve your favorite meals every night when you get home. Through IoT technology, you may be able to control your Robot Maid from the office and program him to turn on your washing machine before you are home. Who doesn't want one of those robots?! So you can imagine that consumer demand for such robots will be really high. At this point technological limitations are the main holdback, and eventually pricing could be an initial hurdle. However, overtime you can imagine that many people could have a Robot Maid.  \n3) Robots with emotions could become our companion and maybe even our partner one day: Imagine a world that those of us who don\u2019t find our perfect match (partner) in the world can order a custom-made one online that will be delivered to our homes within a few weeks! How powerful, cool, and convenient is that!?  \nOk, we may not be there yet, but we are surely moving towards that direction. Jibo or Neo are the first steps towards social robots with emotions and human-like personalities. Overtime, we will see more robots who can imitate human behaviors, show us emotions, and thoughtfully react to our needs. They can carry conversations with us just like a friend or partner and can show us love and emotions.\nAlthough all the scenarios mentioned above required a lot of work and technological advancement to become a reality, I\u2019m optimistic and can see these happening in the coming decade.\nPlease spread the word by sharing this article and share your point of view in the comments."}, {"author": "Yasi Baiani", "headline": "10 Management Lessons Learned - From Harvard to Startup & Large Firms", "body": "During the last decade, I\u2019ve had the opportunity to take on various roles in companies of all sizes. My experiences have included being the founder of a startup, Product Lead in a high growth tech company, and Product Gal in a multi-billion dollar publicly traded healthcare IT firm. I also acquired management and leadership training at the best institution known for these topics -- Harvard Business School -- and spent two years analyzing hundreds of cases on the best and worst management and leadership styles.\nThrough all these experiences, I have learned a lot about management and leadership. Here are my top 10 take aways about what every manager/leader should do in order to succeed:    \n1. Master communication: This is the \u201cgolden rule\u201d of leadership and management. Clear and timely communication with your team is the most powerful tool you can have in your leadership toolkit.\n\n2. Share the vision, the pleasure, and the pain: The best way to get your team\u2019s support and buy-in is to share your vision with them and describe the foundation for certain decisions. Understanding the logic behind any decision allows your team to cope with a tough situation much better and support you and your decision. I repeatedly heard from my teams that they appreciated \u201ctransparency,\u201d even if the message delivered contained uncertainty or challenges.\n3. Don\u2019t just tell your team what to do, but also tell them why: Most people tend to be more inclined to do a great job on something when they understand the reasons behind the request. Your team will most likely end up doing a much better job on any project and request if you articulate how their contribution will impact the big picture and the company's success.\n4. Be an outstanding listener: Some may think leadership is about commanding others what to do. But, in fact, the most successful leaders are the ones who listen more than they talk. By giving the floor to others to talk, great leaders stimulate the creativity of their teams and enable them to generate their best ideas. Also, having others drive the discussions will provide a manager/leader with more information, which generally results in better outcomes. As was noted in the timeless best selling book, How to Win Friends & Influence People, \u201cNo one likes to take orders; asking questions is the way to lead.\u201d    \n5. Make decisions and stand by them: If you are in a leadership and management position, your teams and employees look up to you for answers and decisions. You may not have all the answers and all the information at all times, but don\u2019t forget that a big part of your job is to make the best judgement calls in lieu of unknowns. Try to gather as much information as you can to make informed decisions, but don\u2019t be one of those leaders that can never make up his mind. No one likes to work with those people.\n6. Remember to appreciate those who have done a good job: Everyone likes being appreciated; everyone likes being recognized. Be aware of this basic human need and make sure to appreciate your team members, your employees, and your colleagues. Every small thank you or recognition counts. And guess what? Employees tend to do a better job for the managers who recognize their work and appreciate them versus for those who don\u2019t.\n7. Support the best ideas, no matter who brought them up: In merit-based cultures, best ideas can get traction regardless of who brought them up. In companies with high politics, a lot of times the best ideas get shut down if they didn\u2019t come from the right person - top level executives. Such companies lose the opportunity to consider some of the best ideas because they shut them down too quickly. They also regularly frustrate some of their most talented people, which eventually leads to high attrition or low performance.      \n8. Be honest about what type of people you want and can hire: Theoretically, everyone wants to hire Type A players and top talents. However, it\u2019s a lot harder to engage and satisfy Type A employees than Type B or C. Is your company ready to hire Type A talent? Do you have the right infrastructure and team setup to empower Type A players? If not, you would be better off hiring Type B players because you won\u2019t be able to maximize on what the Type A players have to offer anyway.\n9. Don\u2019t trick your team: There is nothing more bothersome to employees than a dishonest manager. I have heard frustrated employees telling stories of managers who said things like, \u201cThis meeting is a safe place and an open platform for you to share your complains or things we can improve in our team or company.\u201d And then that same manager used the employees\u2019 feedback against them and brought them down. This is not cool and not acceptable!  \n10. Discover each person\u2019s talent and style: Not every employee is the same. Each person has his/her own personality, work style, strengths, and weaknesses. Best managers quickly recognize these differences in each person and work with that employee according to his/her style. Basically, managing other individuals isn\u2019t a one-size-fits-all. You need different tactics for different people on your team. Mastery comes when you apply those tactics smoothly and interchangeably without you or others even noticing. \nWhat do you think about any of these points? Have you experienced the same things as a manager or as a team member? Please share your experiences and insights about management and leadership for all of us to learn from each other. "}, {"author": "Yasi Baiani", "headline": "What to Expect in 2015 in the Wearable & IoT World?", "body": "[This blog is my personal view of the wearable market and doesn\u2019t reflect the view of the organization I work for.]\nFor much of 2014, wearable technology has been the subject of great hype and even greater skepticism, fueled by speculation around whether these emerging devices will have a positive or negative impact on our lives. Some people think that wearables are a fad. Others claim they have no impact. However, many of us believe that wearables are here to stay! We suspect that the ability to collect data about ourselves and our surroundings are phenomena that will change our lives forever for the better, and that they will not go away anytime soon. We are now at the tipping point of the wearable revolution. Here are some of my predictions for what we will witness in the rest 2015:\n1. Wearables will go mainstream: One in five American adults already owns a wearable device, according to a PwC report. That\u2019s on par with tablets in 2012, when the adoption rate sat at 20% after just two years on the market. Today more than 40% of Americans own a tablet, and it seems reasonable to expect similar adoption patterns with wearables.\nEnterprises will play a major role in subsidizing and mainstreaming wearables in 2015. Many enterprises already embrace health and fitness trackers as part of their corporate wellness programs. We will see more companies subsidize smart watches and fitness trackers, especially as these products become more cross-functional. Imagine the benefits that wearables could bring to organizations if their employees could receive texts or emails on their wrists or be able to access company\u2019s applications and documents through these devices 24/7. This could directly impact employee\u2019s responsiveness and productivity.\nIn addition, if wearables could even slightly improve the health and wellbeing of employees, cost savings for employers could be significant. Interestingly enough, employers and employees\u2019 incentives seem to align in this regard. While employers could benefit from reduced healthcare costs, employees could also enjoy lower health insurance fees in addition to increased health and wellbeing. In fact, 70% of consumers reported that they would wear employer-provided wearables in exchange for a break on their insurance premium.\n2. Transition from tracking to changing behavior: Critics of wearables complain that these products merely track and present data about the past without any predictive analysis or mechanisms to help users change their behavior for better. This criticism has merit, but it is important to note that passive data tracking is only the first phase of the wearable movement, and a necessary building block for what can be done next. Changing a user\u2019s behavior and providing her with predictive insight would not have been possible without going through the first stage of passive data tracking. In near future, with machine learning and big data analytics, wearables and digital health companies could significantly help users to take appropriate actions and make healthier decisions real time.\n3. Coupling of wearables & Internet of Things (IoT): The line between wearables and the IoT will get blurry in 2015. As users acquire more connected devices and start collecting more data about themselves, their homes, and their surroundings, their needs will change rapidly. Imagine the potential experience of a user with five or more devices \u2013 all of which collect data about her and her environment. It\u2019s easy to see that the marriage of wearables and the IoT could create new problems such as reconciliation of data as well as connection and communication across devices, but the flip side of that is the potential for numerous new market opportunities.\n4. Explosion of healthcare wearables: While consumers have not yet embraced healthcare wearable technologies in large scale, they are intrigued. On the supply side, super talented physicians, scientists, and engineers from top universities and labs are working on commercializing health projects and offering affordable digital health products to those with medical needs. In 2015 we will see more of these wearable healthcare products become available to patients with diabetes, Parkinson\u2019s disease, and heart failure.\n2015 may also see new regulations and laws related to these breakthroughs in science and technology. The inevitable disruptions happening in the healthcare system will force lawmakers to bring down related FDA requirements. This will help increase the adoption of healthcare wearables, and it may also encourage insurance companies to pay for the costs of those healthcare wearables that have proven outcomes.\n5. More crashes and burns as well as mergers and acquisitions: Based on venture capital research by CB Insight, $1.4 billion in venture funding has been invested in wearable companies since 2009, with over one-third of the money invested in 2014 alone. There were also millions of dollars raised by wearable startups on crowdfunding sites such as Kickstarter and Indiegogo.\nIn general, the odds of success for a startup are really low. Building a successful and scalable wearable business is even more challenging because of the complications introduced by mixing hardware and software technologies together. Thus, many wearable and IoT startups could fail miserably in 2015 and cost their investors a lot of money. Those companies that do succeed will witness a lot of mergers and acquisitions in this sector. The acquisition of Basis by Intel in 2014 was one of the first transactions in the wearable space. Startups that solve one vertical problem really well could be attractive acquisition targets. The reason is that over time, various functionalities would fold into only one device that user wants to wear 24/7. More mature tech companies such as Apple, Google, and Salesforce, who are hungry for a piece of the wearable market, could snag a lot of small, successful wearable and IoT players.\nOnly time will tell what will really happen for the rest of the year in the fast growing market of wearables. Feel free to share this post and your view on any of the topics mentioned above."}, {"author": "Yasi Baiani", "headline": "The Future of Wearables: Will They Die or Thrive?", "body": "[In the last few months, many friends and colleagues asked me about my view on the future of the wearable market. They wonder if the glorious days are over for the current wearable makers with bigger players coming to the market. I decided to share my thoughts here with you all.]\n\nWhat wearables have enabled is simple yet fascinating! Wearables have empowered us to discover more about our bodies and allowed us to quantify ourselves by monitoring our health, mood, performance, happiness, and actions 24/7. These are captivating phenomena that have become a reality through wearables. This is just the beginning, and it is by no means an end. In fact, the global wearable computing market will grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 43%, from $5 billion in 2013 to $9 billion in 2014 and over $30 billion in 2018!\nWhat follows are my predictions for how the wearables industry will trend. My view is based on analysis and observation of market demand, customer feedback, and user behavior:\n1) One versus multiple winners: At the Health 2.0 Conference a few weeks ago, I had the opportunity of picking Vinod Khosla\u2019s brain. When I asked him about the future of wearables, he said, \u201cThere is not one-size-fits-all when it comes to wearables.\u201d He is absolutely right!\nUltimately there will be more than one major player in the wearables market. Based on my research and data collection from wearable users, consumers seem to have a wide range of preferences in terms of both the design and the use-case of wearable devices. Some admire products like Fitbit that are simple and mainly focus on health and wellness offerings. Others prefer products like Pebble or Moto 360 that are in fact an extension of their mobile phones. Smart clothing is also getting some traction. With a wide range of quantified-self products displayed in this year\u2019s New York Fashion Week including the Ralph Lauren Polo Tech Shirt empowered by Omsignal\u2019s technology, this category will clearly have its own clientele.\n2) Smart versus intelligent devices: Despite the fact that we call the existing wearables \u201csmart devices,\u201d most of these products are not actually that intelligent. What most of these devices currently do is collect data about your steps, weight, heart rate, and calorie intake without much intelligence on top of it to make the data meaningful and actionable.\nCurrent wearables are not able to give you relevant feedback or provide you with useful tips for a healthier and more active lifestyle. The future generations of smart devices will in fact be able to change behaviors. Imagine a device that, as soon as you reach out for chips, notifies you that \u201cThis has 5x more carbohydrates and 35x more fat than carrot sticks (based on 100 grams of each). Do you want to substitute your snack?\u201d Envision a wearable that buzzes when you\u2019ve been sitting for the last 3 hours and encourages you to either go for a walk or at least stand up at your desk. These are smart devices that are truly intelligent and can lead behavioral change.\n3) Everyday products versus single-solution providers: The wearable market will eventually divide into two categories: 1) every day products and 2) single-solution products. Products like Fitbit fitness trackers, Apple Watch, and Samsung Galaxy Gear will fall into the first category. Over time they will continue to become more sophisticated with more functions packed into a single device.\nOn the other hand, there will be a significant market for single-solution products that solve one problem really well and will be appealing to a specific group of users. For instance, pregnancy monitoring products will be in high demand, but they will be only attractive to pregnant women and only for a period of time \u2013 during their pregnancy. Zepp is another example of a single-solution provider. It allows tennis or baseball players to analyze their swings; while this is a useful product for a certain group of users, it is not for everyone or for everyday, all day usage.\n4) Software versus hardware: Some argue that the future of wearables is in software and the hardware piece will eventually become commodity. I would argue that there are tremendous opportunities in both areas. As the wearable industry matures, it will become obvious who the market leaders will be -- currently it\u2019s Fitbit with ~70% market share. This will not only create opportunities for many developers/entrepreneurs to develop valuable applications on the winning platforms and build new businesses around it, but it will also substantially increase the value of the wearables to their users. A good analogy to this is the emergence of smart phones and the many app companies that built billion-dollar businesses around mobile (e.g. Instagram, WhatsApp). We will see history repeats itself for wearables.\nIn addition to applications for wearables, there are other emerging software products that will have significant impact in the industry. These players aim to be a centralized location for all data collected by different wearables. They want to make the collected metrics consistent -- independent of their sources -- and digestible by others such as physicians, coaches, employers, and insurance companies. Some players in this category include Apple\u2019s Healthkit and Jiff.\nThere is also tremendous opportunity to create breakthrough hardware pieces. On the health and wellness side, there is still room to build products that can more effectively track essential metrics such as glucose and stress levels. Also, an automatic food-monitoring device that can work in the background and track calorie intake without user entering any information will become a reality at one point. Additionally, as a prominent investor and entrepreneur, Bobby Yazdani, told me, \u201cThere are significant market opportunities for enterprise wearables. Think of what you can do if you have wearables integrated to business processes and support business and employee productivity.\u201d The opportunities on the hardware side could only increase as we find new ways to use them.\nAll these possibilities and examples testify to the fact that we are just at the tipping point of quantified-self market and that there will be tremendous opportunities ahead. This is also reflected in the Gartner 2014 Hype Cycle for Emerging Technologies report, where they predict that the wearable industry will continue to bloom in the next five to ten years.\nIf you are a wearable maker, go after it fast and furious. If you are a wearable user, please share your needs and insights, so that these companies could build the next generation of what you wish to see."}, {"author": "Yasi Baiani", "headline": "Can You Be A Rockstar Product Manager?", "body": "As Marc Andreessen said: \u201cSoftware is eating the world.\u201d With more and more businesses moving online, there\u2019s an ever-growing demand for talented designers and developers to design and build the best products. There\u2019s also a critical need for solid product managers (PMs) to determine what products and features to build. Product management has become that sexy role in the Valley and elsewhere. In fact, many top tech companies\u2019 CEOs have previously been highly respected product people (e.g. Marisa Mayer, CEO of Yahoo; Jack Dorsey, Founder of Twitter & Square).\nThe product manager is the liaison between the customer voice and the technical team. She understands and speaks the languages of the developers and designers. She is a bridge between the market and the product. She is the reality between customer needs and technical possibilities (and challenges).\nYou may wonder if the product manager role is right for you. Below, we lay out the main responsibilities of a PM and what attributes make a top 1% PM:\n1) Comprehends markets and customer needs: The PM\u2019s ability to empathize with customers and understand their needs \u2013 as well as the competitive landscape \u2013 is a PM\u2019s most crucial skill. Everyone in the company relies on the PM\u2019s clear understanding of customer needs (via research, surveys, and interviews) and the succinct communication of those needs (via user stories). Read Steve Blank\u2019s \u201cThe Four Steps to the Epiphany\u201d book to help you understand and implement these techniques.\n2) Gets things done through leadership, influence and adaptability: One of the most important responsibilities of a PM is to make things happen and ship the product. But how? You need to work closely with the different stakeholders in the company to understand their interests, their resources, and their constraints. Then, you must synchronize efforts from various groups to reach the main goal: shipping the product. Frequently, resource gaps will exist and the PM needs to get the priorities straight in order to direct the team in the right direction. To achieve the right balance, your leadership skills, your decision making capabilities, and the power of influence will all come into play.\n3) Team player and enjoys working cross-functionally: The product manager role is one of the most cross-functional jobs in a company. As a product manager, you\u2019ll spend the majority of your time working with engineers and designers. However, you\u2019ll also work closely with the QA, marketing, sales, legal, and executive teams. A superb PM will be a great team player, comfortable being stretched in many different directions, and managing different parties\u2019 expectations. They know that there is only one way to win: \u201cas a team\u201d.\n4) Understands and advocates great design: The necessity for simple, slick, and beautiful design is becoming ever more critical. With so many alternative products out there, users\u2019 tolerance for underwhelming, confusing products is diminishing. Thus, building a product that has the minimum functionality required to meet customers\u2019 needs and is user friendly should be on top of any company\u2019s priorities list. As a PM, you\u2019ll often have significant influence on design decisions. Let yourself and your product stand out by making the best design choices.\n5) Solid understanding of technology: It\u2019s a given that, as the product owner, the PM needs to understand the ins and outs of her product. A solid understanding of front-end and back-end technology empowers a PM to make better product decisions and lead the team to better outcomes, faster. It also helps to gain trust from your engineering team (without which, your life as a PM will be significantly more difficult). However, this doesn\u2019t mean that every PM needs to have a CS background or technical PhD; there are many awesome companies that hire non-technical PMs to work on really cool products.\nIf you don\u2019t have a technical background, we recommend getting your hands dirty by learning some coding. There are fabulous online sources such as Codeacademy, Khan Academy, Udacity, Udemy, and TreeHouse. You can start with HTML, CSS, Java, Python or Ruby on Rails.\nMost probably, your goal won\u2019t be to become a hardcore developer. Rather, it will likely be to understand \u2013 even at a high level \u2013 the technologies underlying the products you\u2019re building. This will enable you to ask the right questions to make the right decisions \u2013 even when you don\u2019t have a deep understanding of the specifics \u2013 and give you a huge leg up as a PM.\n6) Visionary: Although it\u2019s important to listen to your customers, an effective PM has a clear vision of where to take the product over the short and long term. If you ask customers what they need and build just for that, you may end up with the situation described by Henry Ford (Founder of Ford Automobile Company): \u201cIf I had asked people what they wanted, they would have said faster horses.\u201d\n7) Analytical and data driven: Some PM roles are more analytical than others. However, any solid PM should use data to drive product decisions. Tracking the right metrics, analyzing them, digging deeper, and finding out why numbers behave as they do are essential skills for a PM. But, combining these with vision and intuition make a PM a truly top player.\n8) Absorbs and remembers significant amounts of details: As a PM you\u2019ll spend the majority of your time in meetings, in which all sorts of information are provided to you from various sources. There are a lot of moving pieces in the development process. As you receive more information from customers about their needs or from developers about unexpected technical challenges, you need to constantly make big decisions. As a competent PM, it\u2019s important to absorb and process a lot of information and apply the details provided to you at any given time in an appropriate manner.\nUltimately, the bread and butter of any company are its products; helping to build those products as a product manager is a high-responsibility role. If you think what\u2019s described above matches your strengths \u2013 and what\u2019s expected of an A-Player PM makes you tick \u2013 then you may want to explore product management opportunities. We also recommend that you read \u201cWhat Distinguishes The Top 1% of Product Mangers From the Top 10%\u201d. If you are a PM, please share your view with us. If you are considering the PM career route, let us know if this helped shed some light on the PM\u2019s role and responsibilities.\nBy: Yasi Baiani, Product Manager @ athenahealth & Matthew Jaffe, Product Manager @ Dropbox. This Blog Post was also published on The Harvard Business School Student Magazine."}, {"author": "Yasi Baiani", "headline": "3 Digital Health Categories That Will Transform Healthcare Forever", "body": "The patient-centric health approach is an inevitable evolution in the healthcare industry that is happening faster than expected. Recent changes in regulations, coupled with new technological advancements and the speedy adoption by caregivers and patients of these new technologies, have created an infinite amount of opportunities for disrupting and ultimately improving the healthcare industry.\nBelow are three categories of digital health startups that rightfully put patients at the center of their business and build products and services that serve unmet patient needs:\n1) Telemedicine Services: Telemedicine is modernizing healthcare. Companies such as Doctor on Demand, which connects patients to physicians via mobile or web video chat, and First Opinion, which matches patients with doctors for unlimited medical text messaging, deliver healthcare services to broader groups. These companies are democratizing medicine by eliminating limitations of distance to a doctor\u2019s office, difficulty of scheduling an appointment, and high costs of doctor visits. Telemedicine companies enable 24/7 access to doctors for primary health issues. That is a powerful disruption to the healthcare industry!\nThese telemedicine companies each offer slightly different services and are priced differently. Doctor on Demand offers video calls with doctors and charges $40 per session. This price is on par with most insurance co-pays and cheaper than most urgent care as stated by Adam Jackson, the Co-Founder and CEO of Doctor on Demand. First Opinion\u2019s texting service is free for all unless you desire a response from a doctor under 5 minutes, in which case you can upgrade and subscribe to the premium version for $9 per month.\n\u201cThere are 1.2 billion ambulatory care visits every year, and the vast majority of people are walking in for something like colds or urinary tract infections that are very amenable to an initial consult over video,\u201d says Adam Jackson. If telemedicine companies could decrease these visits by 10-30%, there would be significant cost saving for the healthcare system and much time saving for patients.\n2) Digital Therapeutic Solutions: Whereas telemedicine companies want to offer quick access to doctors for basic health questions, digital therapeutic companies aim to bring medicine to your home to address more chronic health issues (e.g. diabetes, depression, back pain) and permanent behavioral changes. Digital therapeutic companies utilize mobile and web technologies to bring clinically proven programs to patients more conveniently and cost effectively. Most of these companies also have a coaching system in place to help patients stick to their programs.\nAs Sean Duffy, the CEO and Co-Founder of Omada Health, finds that for any digital therapeutic to be clinically meaningful, the provider needs to clear two significant hurdles. One, the provider needs to genuinely engage and inspire the patient, both initially and over time. Two, the provider must unequivocally demonstrate efficacy of its programs to the medical community by rooting itself in the best science and by producing clinically-significant outcomes.\nOmada, which raised $23 million Led by Andreessen Horowitz, is a pioneer in digital therapeutic solutions, offering a 16-week web-based program combined with coaching for pre-diabetes individuals. Another company in this category is ThriveOn, which offers 8 to 12 week personalized programs that are based on cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) to users with mental health issues. Other companies such as Reflection Health have reimagined physical therapy by offering customized programs and interactive online tools to make physical rehabilitation engaging, effective, and affordable.\n3) Patient Engagement Portals: Engaging and educating patients beyond a doctor visit or post-surgery has become an important topic in the healthcare system. The goal is to offer tools and technologies that facilitate communication with patients beyond the hospital environment, educate them about their health situation, empower them to stick to their medications and diet, and help them monitor their recovery.\nDue to the Affordable Care Act, the 30-day readmission rate has become a significantly more important figure for health centers and hospital executives to monitor and manage. Prior to this, hospitals were paid piecemeal for every admission and procedure during patients' stays. Now hospitals are penalized when patients return within 30 days for the same problem or because of a complication from their previous stay.\nAs a result, many health providers have started using technology to address patients\u2019 needs after an operation or after an office visit with their physician. Startups that are offering patient engagement tools and technologies include: HealthLoop, Self Health Network, and Wellframe.\nThe companies in the three categories above will be changing the relationship between patients and their physicians, care teams, and hospitals forever. I\u2019m curious to hear your insight and opinion about the points above and your experience using any of these services. Please share your view below."}, {"author": "Yasi Baiani", "headline": "Apple Watch Looks Great, But Didn\u2019t Impress the Health Community", "body": "The newest addition to the wearables market, eagerly anticipated and much-discussed, was just unveiled. Apple Watch is now here. Although there are a lot of things to admire about the product, the health community is lingering and wondering what happened to the \u201chealth features\u201d on Apple Watch?\nOn the positive side, the design and user interface were definitely awe-inspiring, but we didn\u2019t really expect much less from Apple, the powerhouse of design. The hardware looks elegant, and the Digital Crown beautifully enables smooth navigation within a small area. Variety won\u2019t be a problem with Apple Watch. With 2 million customizable faces, 2 case sizes, 34 wristband options, and 3 watch models (Apple Watch, Apple Watch Sport, and Apple Watch Edition), we are confident that everyone can find a style that they like.\nHowever, taking a closer look at the health and fitness features of the product has left us less excited about Apple Watch. Although Tim Cook claimed that Apple Watch is the most accurate and revolutionary fitness tracker in terms of functionalities, we find that it\u2019s more or less similar to other fitness trackers on the market (e.g., tracking calories burned or steps taken, cheering you when hitting your daily goals, etc.). One could argue that because of its heart rate and pulse monitoring capabilities, Apple Watch can measure the intensity of workouts and more accurately show the wearer\u2019s activity level. Having all these monitoring sensors in a single device definitely could improve the accuracy of metrics collected by Apple Watch. However, this still doesn\u2019t make us feel that the product is revolutionary, given that there are many other heart rate monitoring wearables already on the market.\nA few design points and functionalities do distinguish Apple Watch\u2019s fitness offerings from others on the market. These are some that came to our attention:\nBy displaying different rings for moving, exercising, and standing, Apple Watch can distinguish between the time you may be gardening and moving your hands/body versus doing cardio workouts.\nApple Watch can automatically re-adjust your activity goals based on your previous history.\nApple Watch tracks the number of minutes per day you stand up, with the goal to motivate you to be less sedentary during the day.\nApple Watch allows you to record and share your heartbeat with a friend.\nApple Watch captures the intensity of your workout, although this claim is best verified when we can test the actual product.\nApple Watch beautifully displays an informative and detailed view of your monthly activities in a glance (see image below).\nWith all the buzz around Apple\u2019s health initiatives, Healthbook and HealthKit, we were also expecting to see more remarkable \u201chealth\u201d features on Apple Watch. Based on what Apple has revealed, Apple Watch doesn\u2019t seem to be capable of measuring blood pressure, hydration, oxygen saturation, blood sugar, or many of the other health metrics Healthbook is supposed to display. These critical health metrics were in fact exactly the type of information that many of us in the health and wearable community were hoping to see in Apple Watch. Does this mean that Apple will fully rely on third party apps/products to collect and share these metrics? Or is this simply the first generation, a work-in-progress that will be improved upon in future versions of Apple wearables? Health metrics like these would allow Apple Watch to create significant health value and substantially distinguish itself from anything like it in the market.\nWe will continue staying optimistic and hope to see some more sophisticated health and fitness functionalities in future Apple wearables."}, {"author": "Yasi Baiani", "headline": "6 Important Product, Design and Strategic Decisions For Wearable Makers", "body": "It is a super exciting time for wearable entrepreneurs! The early generation of wearables has offered a promising step towards what could be achieved over time with the new generation of wearable products.\nThe wearable industry is still in its infancy. Although wearable makers have spent significant effort to marry hardware and software technologies and build cool products, there is still a lot to be discovered, learned, and applied in this industry.\nAs a wearable maker, there are six elements to consider and successfully navigate in order to build a winning product that will be adopted by the majority of the population:\n1) How to impact without too much disruption? For wearables to be successful, they need to change behavior and improve outcomes without too much disruption in the user\u2019s lifestyle.\nThink of health and fitness bands - if they cannot help users become more active, they will fail to provide much value. On the other hand, if they interrupt the user\u2019s daily behaviors too much (with notifications or other nudging mechanisms), users may get uncomfortable and resist using the device all together. Having an impact on user behavior and lifestyle in a smooth and subtle way is the key for success.\n2) Do you make your wearable fashionable or invisible? As wearable makers evaluating design decisions, they wonder if their products should be trendy and fashionable or invisible and subtle.\nObserving the market leaders\u2019 moves signals that they bet on the former. Fitbit partnered with Tory Burch to design next generation of wearables, Apple hired the former CEOs of both YSL and Burberry for its wearable efforts, and Google partnered with Diane Von Furstenberg to design new Google Glass frames. On the other hand, another group of companies put their efforts into designing invisible patches and sensors.\nAt this point, we are at the very early stages of the wearable era; only time and more data about use cases of wearables will verify or nullify some of the early design assumptions.\n3) Where is the best spot on the body for wearables? So far the wrist has been a winning spot for wearables. BI Research projected that in the next five years, 70% of wearable shipments will be smart wristwears. Many health & fitness bands including Fitbit, Jawbone, and Sony SmartBand, as well as smartwatches such as Pebble, Basis, Moto 360, LG G watch, and Samsung\u2019s Gear Live, chose the wrist versus other parts of body for their products.\nHowever, the question many wearable makers are still trying to answer is if there are better places for wearables on or even inside the body. Some believe having wearables on the waist, inside ears, or under the skin would provide more accurate information. Others argue that the finger might be the best place, particularly for gesture-controlling wearables (e.g., Nod). At this point, many wearable makers seem to be experimenting with different options in search of the best solution.\n4) How do you address battery life of your product? Users don\u2019t like the mental burden of charging their wearables on a weekly basis. They view it as a disruption to their daily routine and report it as one of the main reasons to abandon their devices. Knowing this, it\u2019s critical to make the charging process as frictionless as possible. Analysis by Credit Suisse expects that battery constrains will force more computation intensive activities to run on smartphones rather than on wearables.\nBased on an IHS report, lithium polymer batteries will take the predominant share -- 73% of total -- of wearables\u2019 battery revenue. That\u2019s because they are lighter and can be manufactured into a wider range of shapes and sizes, compared to traditional lithium-ion batteries. If you have to guess, what would be your projection of the winning battery type for future wearables?\n5) What are your privacy beliefs and guidelines? People hold a variety of opinions when it comes to privacy standards. Many come to believe that there is no privacy in this day and age. Entrepreneurs like Larry Page wish to make health data public. Others are concerned about the possible privacy nightmares in the world of wearables and connected devices.\nAs the FDA recently loosened up regulations on tracking devices and health apps, entrepreneurs in these fields got excited about the opportunities ahead. However, privacy advocates are utterly distressed! Their concern is that consumers may not be aware of the type or scale of data being collected about them. With increase in Internet-connected devices, companies would gain unfair advantage over consumers, knowing very detailed information about their personal life, activities, and behaviors.\nAs a wearable maker you can take a few steps to build trust with your users:\nFind out your privacy beliefs as a company\nBe transparent about your security and privacy rules\nClearly mention what your policies are regarding connecting and sharing data with other applications and products\nEnsure your technological architecture can deliver what you promise in terms of security and privacy controls\nStay accountable to your terms of service and your privacy policy\n6) What\u2019s your distribution strategy? Over 250 wearable companies presented their products at CES in early 2014. The number of wearable companies will continue to increase as more entrepreneurs and innovators see opportunity in this category. The critical question is which brands and products will outlast others and become the product of choice by the majority.\nPart of the challenge for wearable companies would be to get their products in the hands of users in the first place. That means a race for distribution.

Having a solid response to these questions will empower you to differentiate your company and product in this crowded and competitive market."}, {"author": "Yasi Baiani", "headline": "What Wearables 2.0 Should Focus On", "body": "The wearable market is exploding! The notion of quantified-self and the desire for data collection about our bodies and behaviors have become so important and valuable that many entrepreneurs and established companies have devoted a lot of resources to build products to address these needs.\nFitbit, with over 67% of the market share in 2013, has been by far the leader in the wearable market. Apple just launched its HealthKit, which aims to connect the world of health from multiple dimensions by facilitating the accumulation and access to the health data. Salesforce bet on wearables by launching its Salesforce Wear Developer Pack to enable developers to build applications for a variety of wearable devices. Google, Facebook, Samsung, Motorola, and LG all have joined the wearable party!\nAlthough most of these wearables will end up offering various functions (e.g. taking pictures, receiving text messages, pushing relevant information to user) the \u201chealth\u201d offering will be by far the most revolutionizing and important component of all successful wearable devices. That\u2019s why companies like Apple and Google made big bets, hiring top influencers of the healthcare industry to lead their health and wearable initiatives. Given that, the question becomes what does a wearable 2.0 need to offer in order to be a winning wearable product?\nBelow are some of the most important factors that wearable 2.0 companies need to focus on:\n1) Provide More Accurate Data: Many skeptics of wearables 1.0 rightfully question the accuracy of data collected by the monitoring devices. Even the basic information tracked by wearables 1.0, such as steps taken or calories burned, is not really accurate. For instance, if you do bikram yoga and burn about 450 calories, your Fitbit or Jawbone wristbands won\u2019t capture any of that.\nBecause of their lack of accuracy, wearables 1.0 failed to establish trust with mass population and can\u2019t yet be confidently used by physicians and care providers for medical decisions. Aggregating accurate data that could be used for preventive care and diagnosis is a much harder, yet much more important nut to crack! Offering more accurate metrics is the first step for wearables 2.0 to establish trust with those who want to quantify themselves (users) and those who want to quantify others (physicians or coaches).\n2) Offer More About Health Than Only Fitness: Most of the current fitness trackers collect information about the number of steps taken, calories burned, and duration of high intensity workouts. Some of them like Fitbit and Jawbone also track your sleep and allow you to manually keep track of your food intake.\nAlthough these might have been interesting metrics to offer for wearables 1.0, they won\u2019t be enough for wearable 2.0 products! Wearables should move beyond fitness and focus more on health. They need to track more biometrics and health metrics such as glucose level, oxygen saturation, heart-rate, heart rhythm, respiration rate, blood pressure, temperature, cortisol level, and adrenaline level to better demonstrate an individual\u2019s health status at any given time. Being able to provide a 24/7 health snapshot of an individual will be invaluable and make a much more compelling usecase for the wearable 2.0 devices.\n3) Offer Tools That Make Data \u201cActionable\u201d: Collecting all of these health metrics alone won\u2019t be that useful. Being able to make the accumulated data digestible, comparable, and actionable is what wearable 2.0 companies should focus on. Research shows that \u2153 of wearable owners depart their devices within the first 6 months. Based on my interviews with many of these users, I learned that they expect their wearables not only track their health and activity metrics, but also help them to improve those numbers. For wearable 2.0 makers to succeed:\n- They should classify collected data from people of the same age, gender, and health profiles and create indexes.\n- Then, they should provide those indexes to users, so that each user could compare his performance relative to others in the same category.\n- Finally, they should incorporate features and levers in the product that encourage everyone to be at their best and improve from their baseline.\n4) Integrate Into the Healthcare System: For wearables 2.0 to have real impact, they need to be integrated into the healthcare system. Collecting more health metrics and more accurate data are definitely right steps towards building trust and credibility with physicians and care providers. In order to widely penetrate into the healthcare system and become part of a doctor\u2019s daily workflow, wearable 2.0 makers should focus on two things:\n- Establish partnership with existing technologies and systems in hospitals and physicians\u2019 offices. Great examples of such partnerships are Apple\u2019s integration with Epic and the Mayo Clinic. We need more of these in order to have a win-win-win situation for users/patients, wearable makers, and care providers.\n- Offer features that address care providers\u2019 needs (e.g. a dashboard with charts and tables to easily demonstrate a user\u2019s health metrics).\nWearables are and will be one of the most disruptive and exciting phenomena of our era! In addition to the points mentioned above, there are a few other elements that wearables 2.0 should get right in order to become the desired product everyone wants to wear 24/7. These elements include the design, privacy factors, battery life, and all-in-one-device offering. I\u2019m looking forward to seeing the next generations of wearables evolve rapidly to empower us with an amazing amount of information about ourselves and offer us exceptional user experience."}][{"author": "Louis M. Profeta MD", "headline": "God May Make You Explain Why You Skipped Your High School Reunion", "body": "I had a brief crush on her in high school. Which, for me, meant I just kind of stared at her from across the room for half a semester during third period. I don\u2019t think I ever said three words to her in my entire life. I did tell her dad she had died, though.\nAt the time, I didn\u2019t even realize it was her. Up until that point she was \u201cthe cardiac arrest in room 38,\u201d until it hit me square in my throat after I heard her name. I put the chart down, took a deep breath and slowly eased the door back open then softly closed it behind me as if I was trying not to disturb her. I gently pulled back the sheet from just under her eyes and brushed her hair from across her face hoping there was some mistake. There wasn\u2019t. It was her \u2026 it was her. I briefly recall thinking that I wish I had spoken more than a few words to her in history class. I told her I was sorry that I couldn\u2019t have helped and I left to tell her father the horrible news. Come to think of it, it may have been fourth period history class, if I remember it correctly.\nFor more than 25 years, I\u2019ve been privileged to practice emergency medicine at a Level 1 trauma center just a couple miles down the street from my alma mater, North Central High School, class of 1982 ... GO PANTHERS. I graduated with more than 1,000 students. So, in many ways, since about 1990, I have been experiencing a high school reunion of sorts, caring for classmates, teachers and their families and countless others linked to that four-year expedition through adolescence. Blessed and humbled by the successes and sadly haunted at times by the failures, I\u2019m still always amazed at how each of us change physically, mentally, emotionally and spiritually as we age and how often I\u2019m left thinking:\n\u201cI wish I had known them better in high school. I wish I had said more than a few words to them when we were kids.\u201d\nSome of us gloss over a reunion notice as nothing more than an invitation to some Friday night gathering we might attend if we are in town, but there is a reason why high school reunions evoke so much visceral emotion with so many of us. It is a four-year snapshot of the most formative, terrifying and confusing years of our lives. It is a one-acre photo riddled with imagery and emotion, heartbreak, elation, cattiness, anger, success, failure, friendship, loneliness and every single feeling that can rain down, like a Texas hailstorm, upon the frail head of a teenager. So much of it we would like to forget and so much more we in time hope we could hold on to forever. As those five and ten year milestones are reached, we quickly come to realize that no matter how worldly and self-aware we thought we were then, we didn\u2019t know shit at sixteen, seventeen or eighteen. We were simply children in grown up bodies.\nIf I hand you a photo when you were 18, taken of yourself in sixth grade, perhaps just one of those \u2018hanging around in the basement with a couple of friends\u2019 kind of snapshots you\u2019d probably say something like: \u201cI can\u2019t believe my mom cut my hair like that and sent me to school wearing that horrible sweater. I look awful.\u201d\nIf I showed you that same picture when you were 20, a couple years of college or the military or life in the real world under your belt, you\u2019d peer at it perhaps behind a hint of a smile and say, \u201cIkk\u2026my hair, my teeth. I kind of liked that sweater though.\u201d\nIf I showed you that photo when you were 40, you\u2019d pause and look past it as if you were simply holding vapor and say to yourself: \u201cMy children are the same age as I was in this photo. My god we were young.\u201d\nIf I showed you that picture when you were 50, you\u2019d look at it, slowly caress the edges, sniff the paper, think about the friends in the photo and briefly try to recall the exact day it was taken, then slowly lay the picture back down and say to yourself: \u201cThose were great friends to have as a kid; I wonder whatever happened to that sweater. I should call her, catch up.\u201d\nNow of course if I showed you that photo when you were 85, you\u2019d look at it and say: \u201cThose were damn fine clothes we wore back then, nobody appreciates good sweaters anymore, all that crap people wear now a days. No self-respect.\u201d Trust me when I tell you that you would also be damn blessed if you could remember the names of the other people in the photo, too.\nThe snapshot is frozen but our eyes change minute to minute. Our experiences change how we view the world at any given time and that includes those kids you were \"forced\" to spend four years with, those kids you might have loathed, found petty or hated.\nThe reunion however gives you a chance to pass the photo around and see it with new eyes.\nMost of us are keenly aware that there are horrible and heart-wrenching reasons one may never want to open those high school pages again, but even people who have experienced the worst imaginable tragedies in history \u2014 from crime to war to sickness \u2014 often eventually make it back to the place they escaped from and found themselves glad they did. Fortunately, very few of us carry that kind of emotional burden in regards to how we envision our high school years. And, if there are those in our class that do, then it behooves us even more to at least try to bring them back into the fold and make it right for them, offer them peace and closure and tell them: \"We\u2019re sorry, we should have acted differently.\"\nEither way, each of us in a sense are stockholders of the history of a four year block of time, under one building, in one location, with one group of people who for better or worse shared a collective experience. It\u2019s also a history that will fade with the final passing of the last graduate. Reunions help remind us of that we were just kids back then. In a way they allow us a chance to laugh at ourselves, forgive ourselves and more importantly forgive others.\nSo you \u201chated high school\u201d and you \u201chated those kids\u201d and you swore you\u2019d never go back. Just go, even for a few minutes, say hello to one person you haven\u2019t seen in 20 years. Say a kind word no matter how small, some fleeting memory you had of someone that for some reason stuck with you all these years. Perhaps tell a classmate you are sorry, give someone else the chance to say the same to you. Go in with the idea that maybe it\u2019s not all about you, but about the collective \"us\" too.\nIn a world in which everything is recorded and archived, it\u2019s kind of nice knowing that we create with our group memories this nostalgia sand castle built by each of our hands, then sit back and watch it sink back into the sea.\nMost of us left high school with a bag of emotional pebbles and stood on the shore and tossed them into the water and said, \u201cGoodbye, good riddance, to hell with all of you, I\u2019m out of here.\u201d We watched the ripples fan out across the water and fade to glass.\nPerhaps this year, though, you go to the reunion. It\u2019s a Friday night chance to pull the pebble from the water and see the ripples in reverse ... and just perhaps give you a chance to say a kind word or a simple hello to the boy or girl who you barely knew, and never spoke to, who sat across from you in history class.\nDr. Louis M.

I\u2019m talking about the great big compacted, rain-soaked, sun-baked kind of dirt pile, replete with discarded pieces of construction scraps, chunks of concrete, a beer can or two and some good old-fashioned roofing nails capable of putting the eye out of a sperm whale. That pile of dirt: the dirt of new sewer lines, the dirt of room additions, the dirt that made any backhoe a thing of legend to every kid in the neighborhood.\nIf you grew up anywhere in America, especially around 1970s or '80s, then you know exactly what I am talking about. Because in the era preceding the step-by-step Lego \"model\" generation, the battery operated toy generation, the Call of Duty, Xbox and Nintendo generation, the generation of play dates and parental warning stickers, there existed an attractive nuisance of such awe-inspiring captivation it rivaled Disneyland\u2026 the pile of dirt.\nA pile of dirt, a shoebox filled with Hot Wheels and Matchbox cars, a can of GI Joes (the tiny plastic ones with their feet melted together) and a couple scraps of wood and you had it all. You were a general, an off-road racer, a God. You made avalanches, jumped Grand Canyon-sized ravines, and rolled and crashed cars with such reckless abandonment that rumor had it Ralph Nader was thinking of banning you from grade school. You dug rivers, built forests and caves and mountains. You burned plastic soldiers with stolen matches that once lit Lucky Strikes, in a battle for hilltop supremacy. Barbie dolls with torn-out hair and chewed up feet became unwilling pedestrians of reckless drivers in two-inch-long '67 Mustangs whose tires were bent and hoods would no longer close. \nYou built ramps, dug tunnels, made cities and forts. You caked your nails with so much dirt that your teeth would grate on the grit as you ate your peanut butter sandwiches with the crusts still on. Banana seated orange Schwinn stingrays launched across the mounds in aerial acrobatics clearing entire armies and fortresses of those green plastic soldiers, sun-bleached Lincoln logs, parking lots of the colored corvettes and the shattered remnants of the Malibu Barbie beach house which now littered the landscape. Minutes became hours and hours became days and time took its toll as the constant digging, the rain, the sun, the bikes changed the pile into a firm, rounded breast, then a flattened, clay-grey spot, then a patch of weeds and finally fading into the memory of the lawn. \nWhat ever happened to the big pile of dirt? How sad, the closest most of us will ever again get to this thing of beauty is looking at it from below.

You might be putting on a set of brakes, or finishing up installing an air bag or anchoring down the final assembly of a seatbelt. You might be looking up at the clock and thinking about quitting time or perhaps the soccer game your kid will be playing this upcoming weekend. You might be having a good day or a bad day or perhaps just one of those \u2018days\u2019 that melts into the next and into the next. You most likely will not be thinking for a minute that what you do right now will save my life or years down the line that of a six-year-old child dying of an allergic reaction. Confused? Let me explain\u2026and say thank you.\nMy name is Louis Profeta. I am an emergency physician in Indianapolis, Indiana. I think I have a pretty stressful job, that of an ER doc in a major metropolitan emergency room but who doesn\u2019t have a stressful job. I have been doing this a long time. It\u2019s an amazing profession, lots of rewards, sometimes magical, other times tragic. Like any job, you just have to sometimes, step back, just go somewhere, lie down and breathe. So I did just that.\nA friend of mine and I hopped a plane and headed for the Caribbean. I was so looking forward for a chance to just get away and relax for a few days in the Turks and Caicos Islands. I rented a late model Nissan Sunny at a bargain rate and settled down for a week of relaxation. \nI was not on the island for five hours when I was involved in a head-on collision with a truck at nearly 40 miles an hour. The impact was incredible, but the breaks slowed the car, the seatbelt held, and the air bags deployed. I suffered rib fractures, a sternal fracture, two broken fingers and multiple bruises. My friend suffered a broken arm, multiple severe lacerations and some minor internal injuries. While he was trapped, I stumbled from the car and lay dying (or so I thought) on the side of the road. The pain was incomprehensible and I could not breathe as I had hoped I would on this trip. I looked up at the dark sky, took one last breath and said \u201ctime to die.\u201d I made my peace with God and I waited ... and I waited. \nI am happy to say that after a long recovery both my buddy and I are doing great. I\u2019m even back to playing basketball. My kids and his kids still have fathers that can hug them and love them and our wives still have their husbands. I can\u2019t be any more forthright in my description than that. My partners in the ER look at the photos and can\u2019t help but get choked with tears since they know there is no way the occupants of that car survive that impact, but we did thanks to you. We in the ER know all too well. We see thousands of these photos that the paramedics bring to us attached to the gurneys of the injured and the dying. We know that whoever was in that photo in most all likelihood was killed. We weren\u2019t; we are still here.\nLast week, I was on my shift when a frantic mother rushed a child into the ER. It was one of the toughest cases I have had in years. She had a near fatal allergic reaction. I was performing CPR on this child in front of her parents. I had to put her on a breathing machine and dig deep into my years of training to save her. I am thrilled to say she survived and she did great. She went home today. But somewhere in the course of this event, while I was desperately trying to save this child, my mind flashed back to you, some worker in some Nissan plant, doing some job you might love or you might hate, who has no idea that what you are doing has such an amazing and spiritual impact on the world.  I just thought I needed to say thank you.\nSincerely,\nLouis M. Profeta MD\nDr. Louis M. Profeta is an emergency physician practicing in Indianapolis.

I had been by his side for nearly five months at that point, spending nearly every night in a chair next to his bed. Since he was stable and between the lulls of chemotherapy, I was finally able to get back to Indianapolis in order to work a few shifts in our emergency department. I needed to still make a living. \nTwo days in a row, my first two days back, I sat in the \u201cquiet room\u201d of our upscale suburban hospital, where we take families in order to tell them the worst news of their life.   \nTwo days in a row, I knelt down, took the hand of a woman my wife\u2019s age, one that was soft and manicured and looked as if it had never held a cigarette or dug a hole in the dirt, and said to her, \u201cYour child has died of a heroin overdose.\u201d\nTwo days in a row, I stared into the frozen half-opened eyes of the cold bodies that could just have easily been lounging in the family room of my own house, playing Madden NFL or Monopoly while sipping a tucked away beer and surfing Snapchat. Cold, dead, lying on the cots in front of me, they stared back and I fought with every ounce of my being not to jump into my car or hop a plane and immediately rush back to New York to be with my own son.\nYou see, heroin is now a middle-class disease, which sadly means one thing: People are finally taking notice.\nSure, you understand what I am saying. If I ask you to close your eyes and picture a heroin addict, chances are you see a wasting male, staggering in a fog, hair matted with dust, perhaps trying to panhandle a buck then copping a seat on a piece of cardboard behind an alley dumpster while tying a shoelace around his arm.\nIf I ask you to close your eyes and picture a heroin addict, you might see a burned out prostitute, makeup all askew, lipstick streaks to her chin, leaning into the window of an old sedan.\nIf I asked you to picture a heroin addict, you might see a couple fringed punk rockers or modern day Deadhead wannabes lying on some piss-covered mattress in a crack house, rubber bands, lit candles and spoons strewn on the floor.\nWhat you would not see is the face of some real estate agent on a Re/Max or Century 21 sign, searching through your medicine cabinet during an open house hoping to find a bottle of Vicodin or oxycodone all the while ensuring you that your home is in good hands.\nWhat you would not see is a member of the debate team, the Spanish club, the varsity singers, the third violin, or the second baseman popping an oxy left over from grandma\u2019s hip replacement and washing it down with a Blue Ribbon. What you would not see is the Junior League housewife, or the winner of the country club\u2019s men\u2019s division who became dependent on one of a dozen opiate narcotics prescribed for his wisdom teeth, ACL or lumbar fusion.\nThis is what my partners and I see in the daily flow of patients into our ER. Those dead, the near misses, those that breathe and beat but no longer think or respond to those who love them, the ones that will perhaps go on to give a liver or kidney to someone else now that they are no longer using them. It never used to be like this. We used to see one overdose a month perhaps. Not one a day.\nNow, it's a heartbreaking loop: the cast-down eyes of a mother of three, too embarrassed to look up. She stole a prescription pad, or was found passed out in the bathroom next to the copier machine; I can\u2019t remember which. Pain, anger, humiliation or even ambivalence are common in these cases. Some patients truly want help, while the majority just want out of the ER.

It\u2019s pretty much what every ER doc now sees.\nI hate to tell you, but heroin is now in the Hamptons, in the tree-lined cul-de-sacs of Highland Park, in boarding schools and SAT study groups of the \u201ctop-rated high school in all of the midwest.\u201d It\u2019s in all the places you\u2019ve moved to in order to escape those places you moved from.\nOvernight, heroin went from being a \u201ccrime\u201d of the wretched poor, minority class our \u201cenlightened\u201d minds envision to a \u201cdisease\u201d of the suburban elite. Funny how things like that happen. Baltimore has about 650,000 residents and nearly 50,000 heroin addicts. They have been fighting this battle for years. They are now looking at the rest of America and frustratingly saying to themselves: \u201cWhere in the hell have you been?\u201d\nLast year, overdoses on prescription opiates killed more than 15,000 people. Heroin overdoses killed another 13,000. That is one dead every 20 minutes. Last year alone, more than 2 million Americans abused or were dependent on opiate pain medications and every day more than 1,000 people will be treated in ERs for abusing prescription opiates. Nearly three out of four heroin users report abusing prescription pain medications prior to graduating to heroin. How many of us have these in our medicine cabinets? I bet for most of you the answer is: \u201cYes, but I only have a few leftover from when I had surgery.\u201d\nDr. Timothy Kelly, a noted addiction expert in our city, told me: \u201cIt only takes a few pills to start the addiction. What's more is how cheap heroin has become, often cheaper than a few cigarettes depending on the purity.\u201d It made me think. Maybe it\u2019s time then to start treating our pain pills more like firearms, keeping them out of reach and disposing of them when no longer needed.\nWhy are we more worried about gluten than heroin, processed corn syrup than oxycodone, peanuts than hydrocodone? Perhaps it\u2019s because we are afraid to cross that abyss and admit that heroin is now something that children of the middle and upper class should be warned about. Our state of mind in regards to heroin has largely been, \u201cI am as worried about heroin as I am my son or daughter will be eaten by a lion in my front yard.\u201d \n\u201cThis is the Hamptons, this is Highland Park, this is the best school district in the midwest with the highest SAT scores.\u201d\nAs an ER doc, let me be the one to tell you ... the lion is in your yard.\nDr. Louis M.

Soon we'll be able to transplant organs from different species", "body": "\"The creatures outside looked from pig to man, and from man to pig, and from pig to man again: but already it was impossible to say which was which.\"\n                                 George Orwell, Animal Farm, 1946\nIf you need a kidney transplant tomorrow, chances are you will wait around three years. Even before you get transplanted, assuming you live, you will most likely spend years on dialysis. Right now there are more than 100,000 people in the US waiting for kidney transplants. Every year nearly 5,000 people will die just waiting for one. On the horizon though, is a potential source of donors that may revolutionize kidney transplantation as we know it. Best of all, it may be that we only have to go to a local farm to get one.\nIn 1984 at Loma Linda University Medical Center an infant girl known as \"Baby Fae\" received the first xenotransplant, also known as non-human to human transplant. In this case, Baby Fae received a baboon heart in a last ditch effort to save her life. Sadly, Baby Fae died 21 days later. \nThe roadblock to success with this kind of therapy in transplantation has always been how best to keep you from rejecting your new organ. This is the cornerstone of the science whose goal is to best match your gift and to protect it for the remainder of what we hope will be your long life. This is essentially the same science that determines blood types and why we need to match blood donors with blood recipients.\nYou see, your body is able to recognize an unmatched transplanted organ such as a heart, kidney or liver, as not being your own. This recognition of the unmatched organs is triggered when certain proteins on their cells cause a cascade of biological processes in which your body mounts an attack on your newly transplanted organ. This leads to organ rejection and possibly even your death.\nThe ability to successfully transplant an organ is a product of two fundamental therapies. First we have find an organ from a donor whose proteins most closely look like yours, and second we have to protect that organ with medications meant to keep your immune system from attacking your new transplant. Even then the organ is often rejected, an incredible loss not only for you but for the family of the deceased or living donor who graciously tried to save your life.\nThe trouble with the Baby Fae case is that the heart of the baboon, while similar in size and structure to her own heart, simply did not look like her human heart on the cellular level. Fae\u2019s own immune system attacked the baboon heart and she died.\nOver the years since the early 80\u2019s there has been a resurgence in research the focus of which is to alter the cells of non-human species and ultimately make those cells resemble those of a human being. \nScientists have started to make huge inroads through cloning. The model that seems the most promising is not a primate such as a monkey, or chimp. Instead the animal that holds the most promise of all potential animal donors is of all things\u2026the pig.  Incredibly scientists have succeeded in removing those proteins from pig cells that are most responsible for rejection. In the simplest of explanations, these pig kidneys, on the cellular level are coming close to being indistinguishable from humans. They are so close in fact that they may not even need to be matched. You can essentially put the same kidney into\u2026well anybody.\nTransplant surgeon Dr. Joseph Tector, and his laboratory at the University of Alabama at Birmingham, is on the forefront of this scientific advancement. They are very close. So close in fact that I predict, for the coming year, that Dr. Tector will put the first pig kidney into a human being, possibly as early as the end of 2017, or the very beginning of 2018. I also predict this will work and change the way we think of organ transplantation forever. \nDown the line I envision huge cloning farms, producing the same pig over and over. Essentially a continuous and unlimited source of kidneys, so many in fact that we will probably need hospitals solely meant for kidney transplantation. In time I predict this process will eventually translate to livers, hearts, even intestines but for now the focus is on kidneys. I am excited to see what will happen in the near future and where we are headed. We just may be on the verge of one of the most significant advancements in medicine in the last fifty years. One that few even knew was within our grasp.\nPerhaps George Orwell was right, at least when it comes to the kidney, in the very near future we may not be able to tell which is which.\nDr. Louis M.

Profeta MD", "headline": "These four words that may offend you ... may also just save you", "body": "\u201cWhat do you do for a living,\u201d the young man asked me.\n\u201cI\u2019m an emergency physician. How about you?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m just a chef,\u201d he replied.\n\u201cPal, I can live a lifetime without medicine. I can only live a week without food.\u201d\nSometimes a group a people you speak to love you. Other times, well \u2014 hate may be a bit strong, but they are far less enamored with what you have to say. This is a tale of the latter, and to tell you the truth, I\u2019m kind of proud of it.\nRecently, an incredibly inspiring physician invited me to speak at a conference, the central theme being burnout in medicine. I really thought I had a handle on this being that I had been practicing emergency medicine for nearly 25 years and I did not feel burned out, which as I just learned is way above the average for ER physicians who typically have a burnout rate of more than 50%. In fact, in our very large private physician group, the rate of burnout and attrition is, well, damn near close to zero. So why is that? What were we doing right? Certainly we are all very supportive of each other. We are all completely bogged down in electronic medical record keeping, seas of bureaucracy, fears of malpractice and other stressors including working far more hours than most other physicians in our specialty. What is it about us? I truly think it comes to four simple words that all of us have grown to embrace. Those words?\nIt\u2019s just a job.\nLet that sink in a bit because when I proposed that to this group of nurses, physicians and nurse practitioners, you would have thought I just stood up and proclaimed I was the antichrist. Even though I prefaced it during my talk by elaborating and saying that medicine is a deeply rewarding career choice, I insisted that it\u2019s not our life. I tried to express that it\u2019s simply a wonderful, marvelous and mystical avenue to allow us the opportunity to pursue meaningful work, make a good living, support our families and to do a job that allows us to see and do many magical things. I also said that I felt it was not a prerequisite to always practice with compassion. Compassion means to suffer with others. I proposed that we do not need to suffer. Our role is to be there, provide comfort, alleviate suffering, listen and be engaged. We don\u2019t HAVE to feel every bit of it viscerally but certainly there will be times where we truly connect and we will. But it\u2019s also OK when we don\u2019t. We don\u2019t have to take every single emotion home, internalize it and make it part of our being. Which, in today\u2019s society of rapid extrapolation, registered as:\n\u201cHe must not listen to his patients.\u201d\nI tried to explain that I feel our emotions wax and wane day-to-day and minute-to-minute. It does not mean for one second that we are incapable of providing excellent care during those times and that this emotional separation does keep you sane and helps prevent burnout and allows you to focus on your job.\nThat wasn\u2019t good enough for these attendees. In fact, one pretty much raised her hand, took the mic and said she was highly offended that I would say or even imply that medicine was just a job. She said she would not want to have a physician like me and there is no way that you can \u201cfake\u201d compassion. That\u2019s when Starbucks entered my brain.\nHow often does a barista smile at you, thank you and tell you to have a good day? How often do you walk away feeling good that he or she was so welcoming and friendly? How often do you know what happened to them last night, what news they got this morning, how much money is in their bank account, what their marriage is like? Let me help you out with the answer \u2026 pretty much never. So do you think that patients are any different than you in those moments? You smile, listen, stroke their hands and offer words of comfort. Do you think the patient pauses and asks themselves about what happened to you last night, how marriage is, what is going on in your life? They just want to feel comforted.\nOne attendee warmly smirked at me earlier at dinner. \n\u201cI just don\u2019t buy your assertion that it is just a job.\u201d She motioned to the bartender. \u201cLook, he just pours drinks and you say my job is no different than his?\u201d\nI tilted my glasses down and stared into her eyes.\n\u201cWhat if I told you that he works three jobs to support a disabled child at home and that this late-night job affords him the opportunity to buy her a few things that make her smile and feel special. Perhaps some toys he could otherwise not afford or a new dress perhaps. You think your job is so much better than his because you hold someone\u2019s hand when they are sick instead of passing a beer?\u201d\nI like to think she bowed her a head a bit in shame perhaps, but I\u2019m not so sure.\nAs the discussion went on that morning, a common theme emerged. Many of these people did not want suggestions on how to keep from being burned out. What they wanted was to be fawned over and congratulated on how compassionate they were, and how they had the hardest jobs in the world, and that no one could possibly understand the work or appreciate how hard their jobs were. I\u2019m sorry, I said. \u201cI just don\u2019t buy it. You invited me; I\u2019m not here to validate you. That has to come from within.\u201d\nYou see, I think we are a bit elitist as to how we view ourselves in medicine at times. Sure, this is a very hard job, charged with emotion; it leads to crying, heartbreak and nightmares on occasion. But it is also filled with incredible rewards both spiritually and even financially.\nOne speaker, who was a physician and also a faculty member at Duke\u2019s school of divinity, disagreed with my assertion and proposed that medicine was different, though. In a way, it was an embodiment of Christ\u2019s principals of healing and was perhaps the first real charitable endeavor. I turned to him and said something to the effect.\n\u201cYeah, that\u2019s all fine and dandy but if it weren\u2019t for the farmers, shepherds and fisherman during that time, the weak and infirm would just have been a source of protein.\u201d\nOne attendee lamented about caring for a patient who was recovering from a procedure that went against her own personal values. She said she was distressed and angered by this; I believe what she hoped for was for me to embrace her distress, validate it, provide words of comfort and support and give advice on how to change. Even though, mind you, she said the patient was happy and very comforted by her care. I looked at her and responded.\n\u201cSo what? That\u2019s your job. You are supposed to provide care regardless of your values.\u201d\nShe snapped at me.\n\u201cYeah, but what about me?\u201d\n\u201cWhat about you?\u201d I replied. \u201cIt\u2019s not about you. It\u2019s about your patient. It\u2019s about caring for your patient. That\u2019s what you signed up for.\u201d\nThis gave an opportunity for another speaker to chime in and take advantage of what he felt was oratory faux pas. \u201cI believe this is more than a job. It\u2019s a passion,\u201d with reverent emphasis on the word \u201cpassion.\u201d The crowed nodded in agreement, then turned and glared at me some more. I gave them one of those head tilting \u201cwhatever\u201d looks.\n\u201cListen, your passion should be your family, those around you that you love. You have to separate the two. There is not one of you that would not abandon your job for the sake of someone who you love and who needs you.\u201d You see, I know this from experience, from deep within my gut.\nTwo Septembers ago, I got a call from a hospital in New York. My son who was in college at the time was just diagnosed with leukemia. Fifteen minutes later, I jumped in a car and drove all night to New York, pretty much crying and pounding the steering wheel all along the way. I called one of my partners and said, \u201cI am not coming to work. I have no idea how long I\u2019ll be gone. If you need to hire someone to replace me, go right ahead.\u201d I slept in a chair next to his bed for 42 days. Do you think for one second I regretted not going to work? I\u2019d give up medicine and clean outhouses at Woodstock for all eternity if it meant I could help my child. People in medicine often say you can\u2019t separate the two. I say bullshit. You just don\u2019t know any better.\nListen, no matter how we like to hold up ourselves as the pillars of compassion, the keepers of the public well-being, we are just one profession out of countless others that keep our world moving. We are no more heroes than the social worker visiting homes in the projects, the farmer up at 4 to feed the cattle, the ironworker strapped to a beam on the 50th floor. We are no more a hero than the single mom working overnight as a custodian, trying to feed her kids. We are no more heroic than countless others who work in jobs they perhaps hate in order to care for and support the people they love.\nMaybe I\u2019m wrong in telling the group that medicine is just a job, but I am damn sure we in medicine are all wrong if we think our job is somehow more special and valuable than the bartender\u2019s.\nDr. Louis M.

I had been mulling around an article in my brain on palliative and end-of-life care. We were not too busy \u2013 in fact, we had no patients at the time \u2014 so I sat down and started tapping away in my two-finger, \u201cnever-took-typing\u201d style.\nTap tap\u2026tap tap tap\u2026tap\u2026tap tap.\nIn just a few hours, between sips of old coffee and bites of stale doughnuts, I had inadvertently penned one of the most-read essays ever on LinkedIn and perhaps one of the most-read articles of all time on end-of-life care: \u201cI Know You Love Me \u2014 Now Let Me Die.\u201d\nAnd when the comments started appearing under the post and the emails flooded my inbox, my heart broke because I came to understand that while my case for allowing you to be comfortable in letting you and your loved ones die in peace was well received, you also shed light on the sad reality that we as physicians were failing you.\nYou commented thousands of times on LinkedIn and various blogs. You wrote a thousand more emails to me and I read them all. Some broke my heart.\n\u201cI\u2019m forty years old in hospice and dying of breast cancer\u2026\u201d\n\u201cI have been torn with guilt because of what I put my mother through\u2026\u201d\n\u201cThe doctors just did not tell me\u2026\u201d\n\u201cThey didn\u2019t seem to care\u2026\u201d\n\u201cThey were too busy\u2026\u201d\n\u201cI now realize how much she suffered because of what I put her through\u2026\u201d\n\u201cI just could not let go\u2026I hope she is looking down and forgives me.\u201d\nBut most of them started like this\u2026\n\u201cDr. Profeta, I wanted to thank you\u2026\u201d\nI simply had no idea the impact it would have and the emotion I would stir. It became clear that families literally were sitting around a table together and reading the essay as they decided to take their father or mother off life support. Still others in the final days and months of their lives were forcing the paper into the hands of their children in order to be allowed to die in peace. I had no idea you would pour your heart out to me and I could literally feel you trembling and sobbing as you hit the send key. I\u2019d see an email from someone I didn\u2019t know and my mouth would dry and my throat would thicken and I\u2019d feel a bit like I did when I found out my own child had leukemia. I noticed people staring at me at the Starbucks as tears poured down my face, wondering perhaps, what was going on in my life. I tried to shield my eyes with a venti.\nI did not plan to leave my mark on the world like this. I figured being a simple ER doc was enough. Is it possible to be thankful and proud, sad and heartbroken at the same time?\nCountless numbers of you, on LinkedIn and other blog sites, were weighing in about how the hospitals and doctors don\u2019t know shit or don\u2019t care or don\u2019t communicate or just want to milk you and the insurer for every buck you have. All jostling to get the most thumbs ups on how best to care for you or your mom or your dad. Substituting the wisdom of the doctor, for some nebulous friend who just a week earlier posted a recipe on how to make a breakfast danish bake out of pop-up rolls and a carton of brown sugar.\nWe live in a world of far too many chiefs and it is now way too easy to get other opinions that are flat out wrong.\n\u201cSo doctor, tell me please. Why can\u2019t you communicate better, be straightforward and honest? \u201c\nI warn you. You will find the answers to some of these questions disturbing.\nYou see, we are just too busy with electronic medical record data entry. This is the new norm. In the olden days, we spent our time in front of you. Pre-med students who shadow me fidget a bit. They want to see patients with me; instead, they get hourglasses and spinning cursors.\nWe are not at your side anymore, answering your questions, addressing your concerns. We have to move on, we have more clicks to do, more print functions to hit. We don\u2019t have time for you. You are our patients, but the computer is our master. You do what the master tells you.\nWe have a breakdown of our doctor patient relationship. We have moved away from our personal doctor to a hospitalist/hospital employee model. Your family doctor does not take care of you in the hospital anymore. Your health defaults to someone whose shift starts at 6 in the morning and ends at 6 at night. He or she is just not as vested in you. Also, the resident physician will be gone in a month and you will be turned over to someone else.\nWe fear malpractice. We\u2019d rather do too much than face the prospect of someone accusing us of doing too little. We don\u2019t want our names plastered all over some rating site or Angie\u2019s List. (It\u2019s good, though, if you need a plumber or carry out Chinese noodles.) You pay the price for this. I am human.\nYou are our patients, but the computer is our master. You do what the master tells you.\nWe are tired and we just don\u2019t want to deal with your arguing families and explain the same thing over five different iPhones; trying to assuage the guilt of children all over the country who may just see you on holidays and who, in many cases, may have an exaggerated understanding of your condition.\nWe also are afraid of you to some degree. The physician is not held in the same reverence as days gone past. Right or wrong, so much of our suggestions are questioned and scrutinized by you or your family. Not to say that you shouldn\u2019t but eventually you have to trust us. I know you will have your experiences telling me I\u2019m misguided. I may nod my head and act like I agree, then I\u2019ll move on.\nAs I said, you don\u2019t trust us like you used to. Sadly we are to blame. Our own communication skills are not the same as they once were. When my own son got cancer, I surrendered myself. \u201cYou tell us what to do. We are in your hands,\u201d I told his doctor. \u201cReally, what do I have to offer? My job is to cradle my child and stroke his hair while you plan his treatment? I know Emergency Medicine. I don\u2019t know chemo.\u201d\nSo much of our discussions have become defensive, so we just quit. We don\u2019t do well with conflict. We\u2019re the china cup generation of medicine.\nWe can\u2019t say no or we are not allowed to say no. Think about it. We ask code status, meaning how much aggressive end-of-life care you expect: \u201cDo you want to be on life support? Do you want to have CPR?\u201d\nI want to be able to say: \u201cYou do not meet code criteria, but I promise to keep you comfortable and to do everything I can do to ensure this, and allow you to see more sunsets with your mind intact.\u201d I need to be able to do this for you. I don\u2019t want to play god; I just want to do what is best and what is right. Please surrender yourself a bit. Let me take that burden off you and your family.\nI know you think your living will covers your bases, but there is a very real possibility that when you suddenly come to the ER in the final hours of your life, your family will panic and override your wishes. They are human too. They love you and are not ready to see you go.\nIn many cases, your living will most likely will not be readily available to us. Perhaps it is tucked away somewhere next to the file folder of old light bills and with that I\u2019ll pound away on your chest. You see, I don\u2019t know you. I don\u2019t know your wishes.\nI want you to ask me. \u201cWhat would you do? What would you hope for if this were you lying on this cot?\u201d Insist and even demand an honest answer, not choices of answers. \u201cDoctor\u2026again, what if this were you, what if this was your mom? I trust your experience.\u201d\nYou should hope for a doctor that knows love. Most of us do. We know the kind of love that transcends space and time. The kind of love that one feels when they hold their child as he suffers through chemotherapy. The kind of love that makes them cry when they think about fighting god for a chance to come down to earth and hold their 90-year-old child in the arms because they love them no less than when they were born. That is the kind of love most of your doctors hold in their hearts. I want you to know that about me. I want you to know that about us.\nWe want to do what is right. We want to comfort you. We want to be the voice of wisdom, of understanding and compassion. We want you to look back years from now and feel at peace. I don\u2019t want to have my mouth dry, my throat thicken or to have to shield my eyes at Starbucks because I opened your email and read that all to familiar in-box lament. The one that reflects a depth of agony, fear and regret that is infinite.\n\u201cI hope she can forgive me.\u201d\nDr. Louis M. Profeta is an emergency physician practicing in Indianapolis.

She rattled off his stats: 94-years-old, surprisingly healthy, looks 80\u2026couple bumps and bruises, better-safe-than-sorry kind of stuff. I stopped her.\n\u201cDid you ask him about the war?\u201d\nShe looked confused, as if trying to recall if this was somehow germane to the patient\u2019s chief complaint as to why he was in the emergency room at the time.\n\u201cHow old are you?\u201d I asked. \n\u201cTwenty-four,\u201d she replied. \n\u201cYou have maybe two years left before you will never be able to ask that question again. This is the greatest generation that ever lived. They died on battlefields all over the world and saved the millions from fascism. They all want to tell their stories before they die.  So let\u2019s check him out and then ask him about the war.\u201d \nAnd for the next 15 minutes, we sat in wonder and rapt attention as he told us with great pride that he had been a bomber pilot, fighting over Italy, the Balkans and later Berlin, where he was shot down.  He parachuted to safety and was taken prisoner, put in a Stalag POW camp, later liberated by Gen. George Patton, as he described him riding into camp on a tank, shiny helmet with a pistol strapped on his side. The student sat silent but glowed in wonderment at what she was experiencing. As we left the room, she turned to me. \n\u201cDr. Profeta, that was amazing. Thank you so much.\u201d \nI smiled in agreement.\n\u201cHe\u2019s fine, let him go home,\u201d and as I typed up his discharge paperwork, my fingers stopped for a bit and hovered above the keys as my mind flashed back to another time I asked that question. \n\u201cSo were you in the war?\u201d I asked the 90-year-old man who looked 75.\n\u201cOf course I was, we all were,\u201d he replied. His well-pressed daughter sat in the corner smiling with pride behind her bronze-rimmed glasses. \u201cI was with Patton in Europe in the Battle of the Bulge. I was a gunner in a half-track; we provided support for the tanks. I manned this fifty-caliber gun in the turret. You see the Nazi planes would start strafing us and, I\u2019d be there in my turret, BANG BANG BANG BANG! I had this foot operated \u2018gun thing\u2019 too you would step on and WHOOF WHOOF it would shoot these big shells out the side.\u201d \nI listened attentively as he talked about the fighting and how his brother was killed in Europe and how he wished it had been him since his brother had two small children. He held up his weathered hand to show me how tall the kids had been when he was killed. I hung on to the bed rail in silence. He told me about his nephews who were also killed, how his cousin was injured in the navy and how he had married the nurse that cared for him. He was animated in his demeanor, as he discussed every detail. The words flowed in a continuous stream of reflection like I have never heard. He held his head high and beamed with a mixture of pride and gratitude that some young punk like me would ask about his war service.  \nThen somehow the talk turned to the holocaust.\n\u201cDad, you helped liberate a camp didn\u2019t you?\u201d His daughter leaned forward in her chair. I thought I saw a faint quiver in his lip. \n\u201cYes, yes, we pulled into Austria and liberated Mauthhausen.\u201d His speech became fractured not like earlier, \u201cThere were these ovens and these burnt bodies\u2026I saw this guy in striped pants, there was this pit, and a bulldozer, it had a huge blade, and well they went all the way to the top and out the sides, and the ovens, and I saw\u2026and the\u2026they\u2026and they were all nude and you could not tell if they were women or men\u2026and\u2026and\u201d his faced turned sallow, and tears filled the wrinkles below his eyes and hovered for a second before falling. The words stuck thick in his mouth. His daughter sat staring at me in silent disbelief, and mouthed the words:\u201cI had no idea, I have never heard any of this before. He never, ever told me this.\u201d  \nI put my arm around him and held him tight. \u201cIt\u2019s OK, I\u2019m sorry I made you go there.\u201d\n\u201cNo, no,\u201d he patted my arm with a hand that once fired a fifty-caliber machine gun. \u201cI\u2019ll tell you this, though, I am not spending the night in this hospital.

Soup would boil on the stove just in case she felt like a sip or two. Perhaps the radio softly played Al Jolson or Glenn Miller, flowers sat on the nightstand, and family quietly came and went. These were her last days. Spent with familiar sounds, in a familiar room, with familiar smells that gave her a final chance to summon memories that will help carry her away. She might have offered a hint of a smile or a soft squeeze of the hand but it was all right if she didn\u2019t. She lost her own words to tell us that it\u2019s OK to just let her die, but she trusted us to be her voice and we took that trust to heart.\nYou see, that\u2019s how she used to die. We saw our elderly different then.\nWe could still look at her face and deep into her eyes and see the shadows of a soft, clean, vibrantly innocent child playing on a porch somewhere in the Midwest during the 1920s perhaps. A small rag doll dances and flays as she clutches it in her hand. She laughs with her barefoot brother, who is clad in overalls, as he chases her around the yard with a grasshopper on his finger. She screams and giggles. Her father watches from the porch in a wooden rocker, laughing while mom gently scolds her brother. \nWe could see her taking a ride for the first time in an automobile, a small pickup with wooden panels driven by a young man with wavy curls. He smiles gently at her while she sits staring at the road ahead; a fleeting wisp of a smile gives her away. Her hands are folded in her lap, clutching a small beaded purse.\nWe could see her standing in a small church. She is dressed in white cotton, holding hands with the young man, and saying, \u201cI do.\u201d Her mom watches with tearful eyes. Her dad has since passed. Her new husband lifts her across the threshold, holding her tight. He promises to love and care for her forever. Her life is enriched and happy.\nWe could see her cradling her infant, cooking breakfast, hanging sheets, loving her family, sending her husband off to war, and her child to school.\nWe could see her welcoming her husband back from battle with a hug that lasts the rest of his life. She buries him on a Saturday under an elm, next to her father. She marries off her child and spends her later years volunteering at church functions before her mind starts to fade and the years take their toll and God says:\n\u201cIt\u2019s time to come home.\u201d\nThis is how we used to see her before we became blinded by the endless tones of monitors and whirrs of machines, buzzers, buttons and tubes that can add five years to a shell of a body that was entrusted to us and should have been allowed to pass quietly propped up in a corner room, under a window, scents of homemade soup in case she wanted a sip. \nYou see now we can breathe for her, eat for her and even pee for her. Once you have those three things covered she can, instead of being gently cradled under that corner window, be placed in a nursing home and penned in cage of bed rails and soft restraints meant to \"keep her safe.\"\nShe can be fed a steady diet of Ensure through a tube directly into her stomach and she can be kept alive until her limbs contract and her skin thins so much that a simple bump into that bed rail can literally open her up until her exposed tendons are staring into the eyes of an eager medical student looking for a chance to sew. She can be kept alive until her bladder is chronically infected, until antibiotic resistant diarrhea flows and pools in her diaper so much that it erodes her buttocks. The fat padding around her tailbone and hips are consumed and ulcers open up exposing the underlying bone, which now becomes ripe for infection.\nWe now are in a time of medicine where we will take that small child running through the yard, being chased by her brother with a grasshopper on his finger, and imprison her in a shell that does not come close to radiating the life of what she once had. We stopped seeing her, not intentionally perhaps, but we stopped.\nThis is not meant as a condemnation of the family of these patients or to question their love or motives, but it is meant be an indictment of a system that now herds these families down dead-end roads and prods them into believing that this is the new norm and that somehow the old ways were the wrong ways and this is how we show our love.\nA day does not go by where my partners don\u2019t look at each other and say, \u201cHow do we stop this madness? How do we get people to let their loved ones die?\u201d\nI\u2019ve been practicing emergency medicine for close to a quarter of a century now and I\u2019ve cared for countless thousands of elderly patients. I, like many of my colleagues, have come to realize that while we are developing more and more ways to extend life, we have also provided water and nutrients to a forest of unrealistic expectations that have real-time consequences for those frail bodies that have been entrusted to us.\nThis transition to doing more and more did not just happen on a specific day in some month of some year. Our end-of-life psyche has slowly devolved and shifted and a few generations have passed since the onset of the Industrial Revolution of medicine. Now we are trapped. We have accumulated so many options, drugs, stents, tubes, FDA-approved snake oils and procedures that there is no way we can throw a blanket over all our elderly and come to a consensus as to what constitutes inappropriate and excessive care. We cannot separate out those things meant to simply prolong life from those meant to prolong quality life. \nNearly 50 percent of the elderly US population now die in nursing homes or hospitals. When they do finally pass, they are often surrounded by teams of us doctors and nurses, medical students, respiratory therapists and countless other health care providers pounding on their chests, breaking their ribs, burrowing large IV lines into burned-out veins and plunging tubes into swollen and bleeding airways. We never say much as we frantically try to save the life we know we can\u2019t save or perhaps silently hope we don\u2019t save. When it\u2019s finally over and the last heart beat blips across the screen and we survey the clutter of bloody gloves, wrappers, masks and needles that now litter the room, you may catch a glimpse as we bow our heads in shame, fearful perhaps that someday we may have to stand in front of God as he looks down upon us and says, \u201cwhat in the hell were you thinking?\u201d \nWhen it comes time for us to be called home, those of us in the know will pray that when we gaze down upon our last breath we will be grateful that our own doctors and families chose to do what they should instead of what they could and with that we will close our eyes to familiar sounds in a familiar room, a fleeting smile and a final soft squeeze of a familiar hand.\nDr. Louis M.

You get assaulted in a mall parking lot and someone comes to your aid, helps ward off the attacker and calls the police? Or, you get assaulted in a mall parking lot and someone holds up a cell phone and records it all the while providing commentary like, \u201cDamn, she\u2019s getting her ass beaten; someone should call the police?\u201d\nJust the fact that you have to pause for an instant and contemplate the answer is proof enough.\nWe are becoming a nation of cell phone cowards, legions of do-nothing iPhone creepers who think that helping a fellow man or woman stops and ends with pressing \u201crecord.\u201d\nI\u2019ve been thinking about all of this more and more lately after seeing a recent news clip of two women fighting in our local Wal-Mart \u2014 the personal hygiene section, I might add \u2014 while a gaggle of Google-eyed, cell-phone cyclops looked on.  \nThe video went viral, predictably, resulting in news coverage across the country. \nWe should take comfort, though; not all is lost. It seems a six-year-old boy stepped in during the brawl and beat one lady over the head with a shampoo bottle to make it stop. You can\u2019t make this stuff up.\nIntervene, or record?\nThere used to be a time in America when we rushed to each other\u2019s aid. Now, we\u2019re more likely to rush to capture someone\u2019s distress for a chance at a snippet of YouTube fame. \nYes, there are exceptions. You surely could provide some real \u2013 or perhaps exaggerated, urban-myth \u2013 examples of person X dying while putting his own life at risk, or person Y getting sued trying to help break up an altercation. But, come on. You probably know someone who\u2019s held a phone out the side window of his car and recorded a crash scene or assault or whatever before giving a single bit of thought whether the police and fire had been called, if the occupant had been killed or if the family had even been notified. \nBut that\u2019s what Facebook and Twitter and Instagram are for, right?\nWe can now instantly post a photo or video of some tragedy and set into motion a chain of events leading to a Facebook instant message from a concerned \u201cfriend\u201d that says, \u201cI was on Facebook and I just saw a photo of a car just like yours. It\u2019s rolled over and smashed in a ditch and I just wanted to make sure you or your kids are OK.\u201d \nNow I do not want to suggest that Facebook is not the way to break this kind of tragic news, and most likely the \u201cfriend\u201d vis-\u00e0-vis Facebook is better suited at breaking this news to you than a police or hospital chaplain or the ER physician and a grief support team. After all, just last week they \u201cliked\u201d your recipe for red velvet cake, so now you have developed a lifelong bond.\nThis is the world we now live in. One where you can see a photo or a video of tragedy that befalls your family way before the hospital or the police notifies you. \nMy take: If it comes to a decision about whether or not you should intervene, it would be more acceptable and understandable if you just say, \u201cI can\u2019t, I couldn\u2019t, I\u2019m just not suited to get directly involved.\u201d That is okay.\nNot everyone has the physical gifts, aptitude, courage or even recklessness to jump in and try to stop whatever is happening. I get it. I\u2019m an ER doc. It took me years to be comfortable in a crisis. I also know that we can be so overwhelmed with emotions that we get lost as to what our role should be and how we should respond. It has happened to me many times. It even happens to those (police, fire, military, nurses, physicians, etc.) who have made it a lifetime career to help in a crisis. But I\u2019ll give you my other take on it. \nIf that cell phone in your hand is doing anything other than calling 911, then you are doing something wrong.\n\u2018Watch a bully get a taste of his own medicine\u2019\n\u2018VIDEO: Teacher beaten by student\u2019, \u2018two girls fight in the cafeteria\u2019, \u2018thug beats up homeless man\u2019, \u2018car crashes into a ravine\u2019, \u2018man jumps from a bridge\u2019, \u2018raging house fire\u2019.\nSure, you\u2019ve seen these headlines and the associated videos.\nMaybe you clicked upon them in some Facebook or Twitter feed. You might have paused the changer on a bit of trash journalism from a rerun of MSNBC\u2019s \u201cCaught on Camera.\u201d This is voyeuristic garbage that, if bundled up and sent to deep space, would make an alien gaze upon it and decide humans are a decent source of easily harvested protein able to be sucked up raw with a dollop of horseradish and a squeeze of lemon. We are becoming a generation of spineless mollusks. \nIt\u2019s sad, because even a slug will dive into a cabbage leaf.\nSome of you might take offense to me calling you or your kid a coward or refuting the argument that his or her recording of the locker room fight between the gym teacher and the student was meant to provide \u201cproof\u201d or \u201cto make sure those responsible were identified.\u201d Please; that never crossed your kid\u2019s mind. What did though, is this: \u201cDude, dude, this will look awesome on Twitter.\u201d\nHere is a bit for you to contemplate. I have yet to take care of a person who has been beaten to hell, whose first words were, \u201cGee, I hope someone recorded that.\u201d Every time you watch a video of someone suffering, either by an accident, an assault, or even some fault of their own, know that the person on the other end of the camera is most likely doing little to stop it, exhibiting a callous disregard for the physical or emotional well being of the individual or their family. In many instances they compound the humiliation by either posting it or doing nothing to stop it. \nWe have become cell phone cowards, a new generation of do-nothing iPhone peepers and creepers.\nOne day perhaps you could be on the receiving end of one of these tragedies and your grief and your distress can be paraded for the whole world to see. \nAnd get a million likes if you\u2019re lucky. \nDr. Louis M.

A good hug is one of the best feelings in the world. I love it when my kids hug me, friends, strangers, whomever. I love it when a patient gives me a hug on the way out. It doesn\u2019t happen very often, but when it does, it feels special.\nMy childhood is filled with hugs from my parents, relatives, teachers, friends, coaches, school bus drivers, school janitors, the lunch lady and on and on. But, now, hugging is not only under threat but in many venues it has been transformed by fear, by political correctness, by threat of litigation and by the actions of oversensitive, self-appointed \"protectors of our children\" into something else. It has been stripped of its transformative expression of love and cloaked in a robe of sexism or, even worse, perversion. It has become something to fear.\nIt only takes a click of a mouse to find countless schools, institutions and workplaces that have made the leap to banning hugging. From kindergartens to high schools, from places of employment to houses of worships, institutions are enacting rules that not only prohibit contact, but threaten \"the hugger\" with firing, expulsion or even possibility of criminal charges. Our bosses, our principals, our clergy, our parents and all of us individually bear part of the blame, because instead of taking a stand and saying \u201cyou got to be kidding me,\u201d we allow them and us to cave into fear of the \"what if\" and we follow along like feral kittens.\nThe need to be hugged and experience human contact is in the root of our DNA. It is the building block of our soul. It is as much a part of each of us as the air we breathe. We curl up and we die inside without it.\nI remember in college taking a psychology class where the professor showed videos of monkeys that, shortly after birth, were raised in isolation and deprived of any physical contact. They often were prone to violence and would sit in the corner hugging themselves and rocking in obvious despair. When placed back in cages later in life with other socialized monkeys, they cowered in fear. It was heartbreaking and even to this day, it is one of the most distressing films I have ever seen.\nOver the years in ER, there are many things that have distressed me, horrible things that wake me up at night. Images of parents hugging the dead body of a their child so tight you are certain a truck could not pull them apart. But the sick notion that hugging is anything other than a form of affection meant to comfort, thank, appreciate, love, or welcome another tops it all. The stupidity of our bosses, school administrators, educators, and oversensitive idiots who think there is something abusive or sexist in the act is beyond description. Oh sure, I know I\u2019ve seen the hyped-up news stories of some teacher or coach, or mother\u2019s ex-boyfriend, who took advantage a child and even robbed them of their innocence. Yes, it\u2019s horrible. Sure, there may be some perverse secondary gain some fringe sicko might find in the act. Certainly we must always work to prevent that. But you can\u2019t tell me that this fear should justify the creation of any policy that regulates an act of comfort and affection especially when that policy bans it all together.\nMy kids went to a fairly tough public school. The junior high football team allowed me to help coach mostly because I was a doctor, I brought lots of first-aid stuff and because I had a kid who was a really good player. There were only a couple kids that were, for lack of a better word, affluent. Many, both black and white came from families of single parents, at-risk kids, etc.\nI made a real concerted effort to never yell unless it was to cheer their effort and if the chance arose always putting my arms around them and telling them what a great job they did that day. I encouraged them to study, usually in my own subtle way.\nI\u2019d put an arm around them, pull them close and say something 'uplifting' like, \u201cHey, Laurell, were you an idiot in school today?\u201d\n\u201cNo doc, I wasn\u2019t an idiot today,\u201d he\u2019d smile with squinting eyes and a big-toothed grin.\n\u201cYou know, Laurell, the world is full of idiots. We don\u2019t need more idiots now do we?\n\u201cNo doc we don\u2019t,\u201d he\u2019d laugh, look at the ground and kick up some dirt.\nI kept up: \u201cWhat about tomorrow? Are you going to be an idiot tomorrow?\u201d\n\u201cNo, not tomorrow either,\" he\u2019d laugh again and shake his head inside his helmet.\n\u201cThen open a friggin book tonight, OK?\u201d\n\u201cOK.\u201d\n\u201cNow give me a hug,\u201d I\u2019d say.\nHe always obliged, awesome hugger, that Laurell. I pretty much did the same thing to all the kids to the point they would stop me, \u201cHey Devon, are you\u2026\u201d -- interrupting, \u201cNo, doc, I wasn\u2019t an idiot today.\u201d\nThen they\u2019d come up and give me a hug. A funny thing happened. In about two weeks, these tough kids, these children of felons, of divorce, of addicts, of poverty, started to come up to me without me saying a thing and give me a big old-fashioned bear hugs, sometimes picking me up off the ground.\nYou could see that not only did they want to express affection, they starved for it. I have three sons, one is still in high school, the others college. My star football player, who is the youngest, does not play anymore because of two knee injuries and I miss it. I still see his teammates, those kids from the past, at school functions or sometimes Steak n Shake, or roaming the sidelines of a basketball game or hanging in the parking lot after a football game. They all come up to me. None of them shake my hand. They saunter up next to me, put an arm on my shoulder until I recognize them and they turn and give me these huge welcoming hugs. It is the best.\nSo getting back to hugs. Not only should schools not ban them, they should encourage them. I propose that when the final bell rings, every one in class needs to stand up, turn to a neighbor and hug them. Or better yet, perhaps a random tone that sounds between periods that alerts students that they have to hurry up and hug someone. Imagine the incredible transformation that could happen if hugs became a habit: at school, at work, in our neighborhoods.\nImagine how the tension might be eased if rival gang members were, for a brief period, to contemplate hugging the guy across from them instead of shooting them. Imagine how the lonely kid might feel, the ugly kid, the tortured kid, the labile kid, the bullied kid, the fat kid, or simply the kid who might feel like an outcast, if some random student who he or she did not know, turned to them and did the unthinkable: gave them a hug.\nDr. Louis M.

I know the Gettysburg Address by heart. I can recite all the presidents. I can taste the difference between Diet Coke and Diet Pepsi, and I\u2019m fairly certain I can tell you the starting lineup from the 1976 Cincinnati Reds. But if you ask me if I\u2019m worried about Ebola, if our hospital is ready or if our nurses and staff are up to the challenge, chances are you will probably hear me say this:\n\u201cHell if I know.\u201d\nI have been practicing emergency medicine for more than 20 years and I\u2019ve seen close to 100,000 patients. I\u2019ve written a few books, published some papers, lectured a bunch of times, pissed off about 10,000 soccer moms when I wrote an article telling them their kids weren\u2019t playing the pros. I once even testified in front of a congressional sub-committee on hospital disaster preparedness. I\u2019m still beating myself for at least not stealing a pen, but it was part of my duty as the physician director of mass casualty preparedness for our emergency department.\nSo you would think if anyone in the emergency department trenches would be versed as to how this Ebola scare will unfold, if it will spread, what to expect, how to diagnose, screen, protect and treat, then I suppose it would be me.\nIf an investigator for Joint Commissions or some other oversight agency, a member of the press or a committee trying to ensure CDC compliance were to pull me aside to spot check my Ebola acumen, they\u2019d be satisfied with my answers and I\u2019d leave them feeling like they had done due diligence as an administrator.\n\u201cDr. Profeta, do we have enough protective stuff and does everyone know how to use it?\u201d\n\u201cYup.\u201d\n\u201cAre the screening plans in place?\u201d\n\u201cYeah, ya betcha.\u201d\n\u201cIs the staff versed in transmission and spread of Ebola?\u201d\n\u201cDarn tooten.\u201d\n\u201cHas everyone read all the CDC and hospital communiqu\u00e9s regarding Ebola?\u201d\n\u201cSure have.\u201d\n\u201cHave you practiced the drills in the ER in case we have someone show up with a possible exposure?\u201d\n\u201cMore times than Lois Lerner has hit her hard drive with a hammer.\u201d\nBut if they were to ask me if there are any other issues they should be aware of, I\u2019ll just stare with round blank eyes and keep my mouth shut until the right question is asked; the question they will pretend does not exist.\n\u201cDr. Profeta, will they \u2013 the staff, you, your partners \u2013 show up? \u201c\n\u201cThat, I don\u2019t know.\u201d\nSome years ago when I first started in practice, a very large hospital in our area was having trouble getting patients rapidly admitted from the ER to the floors. This resulted in a tremendous backlog of patients and extreme ER overcrowding. This naturally increased patient wait times and directly impacted the health of those coming to the ER. So, naturally, the hospital system formed a committee and hired consultants. They looked at every single variable: time to laboratory, time to X-ray, nursing changeover, bed request time and on and on and on. Do you know what they found? The roadblock in the movement of patients through this major medical system was housekeeping. Think about that. Housekeepers, traditionally the lowest paid and least-skilled division of employment of the hospital, were responsible for the movement and throughput of patients more than any other factor.\nIf the rooms on the floor were not cleaned fast enough, then no patients could move from the ER to the floor, and no patients from the waiting room to the ER. ER wait times rose and patient care suffered. Housekeepers handcuffed the entire system, and not because they were lazy. The regulations, protocols and procedures put into place to clean a room are so extensive that rapid room turnover was next to impossible with the current staffing model. That stuck with me. What is the rate-limiting step in a mass casualty scenario or massive patient influx that would handcuff us? Where will all the preparedness collapse? What is the leaking O-ring? What am I afraid will fail?\nAs I alluded to a bit earlier, I appeared before members of Congress who were investigating Midwest medical centers and regional hospital preparedness for a mass casualty event. The focus was on our readiness should a major earthquake hit the Midwest. The congressmen wanted to know if we had the capacity to mobilize our staff; they asked what assistance we needed. Toward the end of the discussion, they asked each of us what we were most afraid of. The responses were typical answers you would give to a member of Congress if you were seeking money (not having enough resources, not enough congressional or governmental support, not having enough staff or equipment or infrastructure, etc.)\nWhen they got to me, asking what I worried about, I simply said: \u201cThe flu.\u201d\nNow, flash forward. I wonder if what I really meant to say was \u201cEbola.\u201d\nWhen it comes to our ER and our ability to provide the best care during the worst extremes, I have no doubt we can mobilize our hospital to care for hundreds and hundreds of seriously injured patients. We have modeled our Emergency Department response to a mass-casualty incident in much the way Israeli hospitals have structured their programs. (As a side note, Israel is light years ahead of us in terms of all mass casualty \u2013 chemical, biological, environmental, mad-made \u2013 preparedness.) Specifically, we model our plan after Western Galilee hospital on the border of Israel and Lebanon. This is a large, major, modern-day medical center under constant threat from Hezbollah rockets from Lebanon. They train and drill with a level of involvement, passion and commitment that exceeds anything we can muster.\nThe staff at my hospital in Indianapolis, however, has bought into it and I truly believe that there is no ER in Indiana, and few in the Midwest, that have a better plan in place. We also gained a better understanding of the type of injuries we would see in each scenario. More specifically, we wanted to know from a pure number standpoint how many patients would have to go to the operating room the minute they hit the door, how many would need to be on ventilators and how many would need emergent life-saving intervention. Fortunately, and not so fortunately, the proliferation of research in this area has provided plenty of hard data well documented in the literature. Ultimately, all things being equal, the data seems to indicate a suicide type bomb loaded with ball bearings or other projectiles placed in a crowded area will result in the largest number of patients requiring immediate, emergent and life-saving intervention. While a disaster like a major earthquake will result in far more fatalities, far less people will require absolute immediate operative or life-saving intervention. All we really need to know is, what type of event, how many patients, and it\u2019s pretty easy to calculate what to expect from an acuity standpoint. In the ER, it isn\u2019t the total number of patients that concerns us, it\u2019s the number we get that will die if not treated in minutes or a few hours. The rest we have no problem letting wait.\nUltimately, though, what I am getting at is that the trauma from a major incident like an earthquake or terrorist attack is very predictable. All you really need to know is the type of event and the numbers and you almost immediately have a pretty good idea of what to expect.\nBut a real bad flu?\nThere is no way you can prepare for it. The goal should be to protect your hospital from it.\nWe have seen influenza pandemics before, the most notable being the Spanish flu of 1918. Researchers estimate between 20 and 100 million peopled died from this strain of flu. What was even more concerning was the number of deaths that occurred in previously healthy people. Each year in the United States, about 30,000-40,000 deaths and 200,0000 hospitalizations can be attributed in part to influenza. Most deaths are in the elderly with pre-existing serious health problems. The Spanish flu of 1918 was different. It killed the healthy, able bodied. It unleashed an incredible degree of viral savagery with an infection rate of nearly 50 percent. It was a biological holocaust.\nDoctors and nurses treat flu patients lying on cots and in outdoor tents at a hospital camp during the influenza epidemic of 1918. (Photo: Hulton Archive/Getty Images)\nThus my biggest fear has always been a strain of flu that is highly contagious with a high mortality rate. The Spanish-flu mortality rate of 1918 was 2 to 5 percent. Ebola has a 20 to 90 percent mortality rate, but it fortunately is not quite as contagious as Influenza. However, I still keep going back to flu and envisioning an epidemic of the Spanish type that will quickly fill all our inpatient beds, every ICU bed, every ventilator, every outpatient bed, every cot, gurney and chair in the ER and in all the waiting rooms. I\u2019m afraid that a flu virus this aggressive will bring five dying flu victims to our ER each day and dozens more with a real possibility of dying.\nThis would occur on top of a department that is always operating at capacity and drowning in documentation and electronic medical record bureaucracy. After 30 days in our ER, nearly 150 people will have died, providers will be physically and mentally spent and morale will be at below-despair levels. Multiply it by 20 or so other hospitals in the area and now we are talking about 3,000 members of our community dead in only a single month. The obituary pages of the local paper will be thicker than the advertising section the day after Thanksgiving. Expand that number statewide and nationwide and the numbers become so immense they aren\u2019t even real.\nNow imagine a realistic scenario in which the flu vaccine only provides immunity to 50 percent of the recipients. That means that half of our ER staff who are seeing all these patients will have little protection, outside of gowns, masks, and gloves, against a virus that is spread primarily though coughing, sneezing and saliva. Simply put, some of us in the trenches in damn near every ER in America will almost certainly die. It could be me, it could be any one of my partners, colleagues and co-workers and it could be one of our children or a spouse who gets infected when one of us comes home thinking the headache and fatigue they are feeling is simply exhaustion from the workload of the day. Can you picture it?\nNow imagine that huge numbers of hospital staff \u2013 from doctors to housekeepers, from food services to registration, from security and parking to transportation will decide not show up. They will call in sick or simply just say: \u201cNo, I\u2019m not coming to work today.\u201d In just a few days, human waste, debris, soiled linens, the sick, the dying and the bodies will pile up. We will be overwhelmed and unable to offer much in the way of assistance because the labor-intensive protocols that allow us to safely care for even one patient are just too exhausting. These procedures are barely repeatable more than once or twice of day, and fraught with so many steps and potential for mistake that it becomes too physically and emotionally taxing for the staff to do \u2026 so they simply wont show up.\nAnd I am not sure I will, either.\nI love emergency medicine. I love helping people and saving lives and I think I\u2019m pretty good at it, but I am also a person and I have a wife and three children that I love and want to see grow up. I also am keenly aware that not a damn thing I do will have any real impact on the survivability of a patient with either the Spanish flu or Ebola. Fluids, rest and prayer is about all there is to offer. There is an old adage that says a hospital is no place for a sick person. I think whoever first said that had Spanish flu and Ebola in mind.\nSo we drill and we prepare and we post placards and do screening but no one is asking why in the hell are they coming to us in the first place? Fluids and rest can be provided anywhere: an empty warehouse or a huge tent in the middle of farmland. Why would we not just take the care to them in the form of special traveling Ebola-mobiles that triage and treat the patients at home? Why can we deliver the mail, pickup the garbage and recyclables at damn near every house in America, but we can\u2019t pull up a retrofitted UPS van, drop off a mid-level provider in a hazmat gown, let them do an assessment, draw some blood, drop off cans of rehydrating formula to their doors, clean linen, biohazard bags, gowns and gloves for family members, slap a warning sticker on the front door, tell them you will stop by tomorrow and move on to some other location? I know I sound crass, perhaps like I don\u2019t really have sympathy for these very ill patients. This could not be further from the truth. I\u2019m just kind of angry. I know there is a better way than risking the infrastructure of a medical center for the sake of a few patients that will either do OK at home with simple supportive care or die no matter what care I provide. We\u2019ve had years to prepare for this, we\u2019ve hung all our hopes on a vaccine and not nearly enough thought on containment should a vaccine fail.\nToday\u2019s Ebola is tomorrow\u2019s Spanish flu. We\u2019ve had nearly a hundred years to get ready and the best we can come up with is plastic suits, double gloves, respirators, and masks.
